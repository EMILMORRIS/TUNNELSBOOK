Morris</span></p><p><span>Lexia is a nine year old girl when she falls into a coma after the doctors administer drugs to treat her recently developed severe PTSD. While in deep sleep, Lexia found herself in a parallel underworld where she inherits a body of a young Sage. The city ELUCID is under no rule except for the local born species who guard the knowledge of the world, the Gaaards. Everyone who lands there has the same objective, fight and kill the demons one fears most, get to the underworlds core and reconnect with their sleeping body. There are ancient tunnel systems, and some lead back out to the surface or a dead end. Once the line to the underworld is crossed, the first demon appears. They reemerge every twelve hours for each Sage, and one cannot kill another Sages demons. Cooperation is out of the rule except for a crystal that provides the ability to pass on fear once for the other Sage. The underworlds Core configures as the clock shifts every hour, and on the twelve hour the CORE freezes and demons are released. The underworld is divided into four layers reaching the Core, as the layers descend the demons become more sophisticated in their attack. They also increase by one every shift. There is only one problem, if the sage dies, they are sent back to ELUCID, but their demon count does not disappear. Some are stuck there for centuries.</span></p><p><span>Our hero, Lexia, is summoned to the underworld realm. She must fight the demons to reemerge with her sleeping body and appear back on earth, but something tells her that she might not wake up on Earth when she reaches the core.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>INTRODUCTION</span></p><p><span>The thing was scratching and pulling Lexia ferociously towards the others. Laying on ceramic hospital floors exhausted from yelling violently for hours she was facing blood drained and skinless creatures. Their muscles were falling of bit by bit shaped like a human after excessive exposure to radiation. The things were crying in pain, as if begging Lexia to stop the torture. Another creature appeared on the right crawling up to Lexia trying to hold on. Something was pulling them back. She was chained to the back wall with a little window overlooking a garden. She has been resisting sleep for over 58 hours, and the doctors were critically worried. </span></p><p><span>&quot;Why wont she fall asleep?&quot; </span>
<span>&quot;We think she is experiencing visual hallucinations that appear violently every time her fear response comes up.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Fear of what?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;We don&#39;t know, but it seems like the experience intensifies when she closes her eyes. For now her lack of sleep further causes the psychosis to intensify. Her sensitivity to any outside stimuli is very high.&quot; The doctors were trying to reason with the phenomena.</span>
<span>&quot;She&#39;s cursed isn&#39;t she.&quot; Severely anxious Mr. Davis squeezed his hat so hard it molded into a banana. Lexia closed her eyes and the screaming erupted again. Her Dad was loosing his screws in the the psychiatric institutions waiting room walking back and forth.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Doc, fifty hours how can you not know? The drugs are not working!!!!&quot; He grabbed on to his scalp scratching his head with anxiety.  &quot;She&#39;s cursed isn&#39;t she. oh my gosh...it&#39;s her mother!&quot; With every new burst in crying, Mr. Davis doubled down on the doctors who were trying everything in their power to sedate Lexia without any serious injury.</span>
<span>&quot;We don&#39;t really believe in such things as curses Mr. Davis, but there has been cases of people reporting monstrous things during lucid dreaming, however this is a more rare case since she is awake. These hallucination almost never occur. I&#39;m sorry to say Mr. Davis...&quot; The doctor inhaled slowly.&quot; She might develop potential PTSD symptoms if we don&#39;t find the right medication for her soon.&quot;</span>
<span>He wiped his face pale. Rubbed his eye lids hard.</span>
<span>&quot;Tell me, what did you find in her blood? Was she drugged previous to coming here?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Nothing irregular Mr. Davis, and we gave her three different pills that have worked on other patients, so far no come downs. The doctors reached out to sister clinics in search of a stronger antidote. We&#39;re waiting.&quot;</span>
<span>He didn&#39;t hear anything else, just the same blah blah story over again. He rested in silence as he watched his daughter scream in agony.</span></p><p><span>Lexia was scratching the concrete pavement when her nails began bleeding. The hospital room is well covered with protection, but not where she appeared to be. Lexia was caged in a concrete jail cell with corners dipped in dried blood and human like limbs laying in pieces scattered around the room. The creatures were nearing on top of her, desperately squeezing her trying to hold on. She wrapped her arms around her head, shaking and crying.</span>
<span>&quot;She&#39;s bleeding!&quot; That was blood underneath her nails from scratching.</span>
<span>&quot;Lexia, this is something that will help you.&quot;</span>
<span>She kept screaming with her head hidden.</span>
<span>&quot;Lexia, we need to give this to you. It will help you&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I don&#39;t think it will work, grab her from the side gently, ill administer the pill.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Cant we get an injection? That way we don&#39;t need to make her open up her front and mouth.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Not at the moment, this is all we got. Get her chest.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia began kicking violently.</span>
<span>&quot;GET AWAY!!NOOOO!&quot;</span>
<span>The doctors were finally able to force the pill down her throat. After fifteen minutes the yelling and the shaking stopped. She fell asleep. </span></p><p><span>Lexia did not wake up. The father developed a deep depression sitting by her bed every day. One year passed and the doctors were amazed how quickly she matured. That didn&#39;t move the Father, he became extremely resentful and through severe depression developed cancer.</span>
<span>Their medical insurance could not cover Lexias hospital bills. But the fathers sister took over the bills. One thing was peculiar, Lexias body matured into a sixteen year old girl in just one year. The medical mystery granted the sister sponsors to further pay the bills.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Chapter 1:</span>
<span>&quot;You have the OKA?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yeah, I said I&#39;ll get it.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;From who?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Jax make me explain something more to you and I&#39;m taking it to the Pawn.&quot;</span>
<span>OKA is a type of crystal relic that allows for one Sage to transfer the fear of demons for one round in the tunnels. Zola was concerned her little sister would not make it through the deep point, thus she went out of her way to get it.</span>
<span>&quot;When do we leave?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;After the second shift.&quot;</span>
<span>Screams from outside the tavern increased. Everyone stepped out to see whats the commotion.</span>
<span>&quot;I found this little maggot stealing my revolvers from the shop!&quot; </span>
<span>The merchant was furious. Lexia was kneeling on the ground right beside him.</span>
<span>&quot;Who is she?&quot; Zola yelled back.</span>
<span>&quot;They appear every couple hours, what am I supposed to keep track!?&quot; He shrugged as he waved his hand belittling Lexia. &quot;You know what we do with thieves.&quot; </span></p><p><span>Chanting began. One of the Sages from the crowd yelled out. &quot;Nude her and throw her in the hole!! Teach &#39;em a lesson!&quot;</span>
<span>Everyone cheered in excitement ready for entertainment.</span>
<span>&quot;Wait!&quot; Zola went up to the merchant. &quot;Whats your name?&quot;</span>
<span>With glistening scared eyes Lexia looked up at her. &quot;I dont know.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Youre in a coma, but your memory should be fine. Whats your name? from Earth?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Earth..? Lexia?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Lexia, stand up.&quot; Lexia lifted her knee up with shame on her face.</span>
<span>&quot;Where am I?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;This girl has no clue whats going on Merch!&quot; Zola turned to her. &quot;Stand up I said&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;The girl needs to pay the price!&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Here.&quot; Zola threw a carabin into the merchants hands. Now the crowds bonvoyage died out and booing began.</span></p><p><span>At the tavern Zola was scouting prospects to acquire cheaper weapons than what the merchant had in shop. Lexia was staring at paintings of old men and women.</span>
<span>&quot;They are the founders of this city. Before, they had to prepare for the hole on their own. Then the first kind evolved on this world after, Gaards.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia took a seat next to Zola, silent.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What is this place?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You&#39;re in a parallel world. Your body stayed in the hospital. The subconscious is a gateway to many worlds. You, or your ego I guess, travels while unconscious, then by mere luck it falls into the pre-conscious state and snaps out of the will of the traveling soul. And you landed here. Most think that there are multiple worlds out there with different realities. Kind of random where or when you land. This world is directly connected to Earth.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;To the doctors on Earth you are lucid dreaming.&quot; Jax continued. &quot;Here, you only fight two types of beastlings, your subconscious Zanima and Zanimus demons.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;What is subcoshis?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Oh dude... she doesn&#39;t even.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;How old are you?&quot; Zola looked at Jax in worrisome. </span>
<span>&quot;Nine, almost ten.&quot;</span>
<span>Zola paused for a second.</span>
<span>&quot;Most people that come here. They are older. I&#39;m thirty two in the real world. There aren&#39;t that many nine year olds here. I&#39;ll introduce you to my sister.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Who&#39;s your sister?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;She&#39;s fourteen. You&#39;ll like her.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia looked at her big legs.</span>
<span>&quot;What am I wearing?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;re not wearing it. Thats your body. Everyone is given the same body at the beginning. Evens out the odds for players in the game. Color does not matter.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Game? i dont want too...&quot;</span>
<span>Zola realized she could be explaining this forever. She nudged at Jax. &quot;Dude, we were supposed to leave tomorrow.&quot;</span><br/><span>&quot;You took her. I got the count to thirty six. If I die above forty demons thats when ill be worried.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Lets pray that doesn&#39;t happen.&quot; </span>
<span>&quot;Lets.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia was feeling her new body out.</span>
<span>&quot;I&#39;m hungry.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it. On ELucid we don&#39;t eat. But the memory of eating, hunger and time stays with you always.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yeah I never got that.&quot; Jax was confused. &quot;Where do we get the energy from? Carbohydrates, protein?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I guess different realms feast of different sources. Here the self recycles. The more we move, the more energy we build up.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia looked around the tavern and yawned.</span>
<span>&quot;Thats not real.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;What?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;The yawning, you&#39;re not tired. You cant sleep. Its just a habit, you think you are tired. But your body isn&#39;t.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;We cant sleep?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;No. It prevents the soul from leaving this world. The only way is reaching the core.&quot;</span>
<span> Zola realized its complex and alot for a kid to handle at once. But Jax had a huge grin on his face. </span>
<span> &quot;If you were looking for hell, this is it kid.&quot;</span>
<span> He put his arm around Lexias shoulder and waved in the distance slowly. </span>
<span> &quot;Eternal existence, no tequila and relentless memories of the things that make life great. Cheers.&quot; He chucked a piece of rubber in his mouth and began chewing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The trio were on their way to camp from the tavern when Zola handed the new girl a shotgun. Lexia pointed at the desert mountains. A crowd of sages were huddled around a crater sized hole. </span>
<span>&quot;What is that?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Thats one of the gates into the underworld. Listen, do you remember what happened to you before you woke up?&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia stopped. She forgot all about it.</span>
<span>&quot;I was screaming. These things were coming onto me and biting me. And I heard my dad.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;What thing? on Earth?&quot; Zola hesitated for a second.</span>
<span>&quot;Like monsters, they had no skin.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Girl, you tripping these things are only here. Not in the real world.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;No I mean, they came when I closed my eyes. They were on me.&quot;</span>
<span>Zola raised her eyebrow in disbelief.</span>
<span>&quot;It must be a real reason. I remember driving a car. Thats all. So it must&#39;ve been a car crash for me and Ten.&quot; Zola hesitated.&quot; Monsters huh? See if Kal can make something of this.&quot;</span>
<span>They took a spontaneous right and headed towards a lugubrious steel fortress.</span>
<span>&quot;Stay here and don&#39;t go no where, okay?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Okay.&quot;</span>
<span>Couple minutes passed and the ground plates shook a bit. Screams from the hole echoed and the market went silent.</span>
<span>&quot;This is Kalgaard.&quot; A very tall man appeared out of the walls of the tower, he looked much older than most people Lexia saw, shaved head with a long beard coming down to his chest.</span>
<span>&quot;Zola tells me your name is Lexia. I&#39;m Kal.&quot; The man smiled. &quot;Tell me, what is it that you saw when you were back on earth. Can you describe it?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;They were tearing my legs apart. Holding onto me, I think they wanted to eat me but I kept closing my eyes. And then their faces would appear in front. It was....horrible.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;And you saw them when you closed your eyes?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Both times. But when I closed my eyes they were right in my face.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Do you know how long you were awake?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;No, but i didn&#39;t go to sleep for a long time.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Were they big?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Big like you, long arms. They were screaming.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Big like me.&quot; Kalgaard smiled gently. &quot;Did they have muscles falling off?&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia looked down and closed her eyes, her fist clenched.</span>
<span>&quot;I think so. There were things on the ground. Like pieces of arms and stuff.&quot;</span>
<span>Kalgaard straighten his back out. He was much taller than Lexia or any of the Sages. No one could tell how old he was but Sages documented speaking to him hundreds of years ago.  Kalgaard and Zola went back behind the walls. Then Zola signaled to come in. Lexia came up the spiral staircase to the tower top. Zola made sure Lexia couldn&#39;t hear them.</span>
<span>&quot;What did she see, Kal?&quot;</span>
<span>Kalgaard stroke his beard as he looked over the garden. His foxes ran around the fire looking for a comfortable place to lay down. Silence prevailed over the camping ground.</span>
<span>&quot;All Sages appear through the fault of their own in an accident they caused. What Lexia saw were demons stripped of their materials, only the soul remains. They come from a different realm. Far greater than here, the world below this one. It is written to be the place where demons dismantle into souls.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I thought you said the soul cannot live without the body.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Not on this world. What she saw wasn&#39;t an accident. She was summoned.&quot;</span>
<span>The fire grew gently as the clouds closed in on the sun. Lexia was warming herself up next to the foxes. </span>
<span>&quot;By who?&quot;</span>
<span>Kalgaard was complacent with the moment of silence.</span>
<span>&quot;Then what does it mean if she enters the hole?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Both Zanima and Zanimus will probably be the same as yours. I&#39;m not worried about that.&quot;</span>
<span>Kalgaard reached into his pocket and disclosed a little rugged down green book.</span>
<span>&quot;She might not return home when she reaches the Core. I&#39;ll dwell upon the matter while you take them to the range. Prepare.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The range was training grounds for newly woke Sages. Lexias first time holding a gun she was expected to work with precision operating it in dark tunnels. However, the range did not help her register the reality she was about to witness.</span>
<span>&quot;Lexia. Go up to the roof, Kalgaard is waiting for you.&quot; </span>
<span>Lexia found Kalgaard standing by the edge looking over at desert mountains. There was a table with a map laid behind him.</span>
<span>&quot;Sit Lexia. I will ask you about your mother and father. Where are they from?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Its just my dad and I. My mother died when I was seven.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;What was her name?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Ana.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Anatrich?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes.&quot; </span>
<span>Kalgaard did not hesitate to look at his book again.</span>
<span>&quot;Did you dream your mother?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I dream of our house. I hear my mother talking in the other room. I always wanted to open the door but I couldn&#39;t.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Where was the room?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;At the end of the hallway.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;And did you walk up to the door.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes, but I never opened it.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;There&#39;s lots of doors in the tunnels Lexia. You&#39;ll have to open them.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia was silent.</span>
<span>&quot;In the dream. Were you running to the door?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;No, it was very slow.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;And your dad, did he appear in the dream?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes. I saw him at the end of the hallway.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Was he coming out of the room?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I dont know. He was screaming.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Can you remember what?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;No. The voice sometimes switched, sounded like a womans voice, than his. I think.&quot;</span>
<span>Zola and Tenenga came up to the top. </span>
<span>&quot;We&#39;re heading. The shift is about to end. We don&#39;t want to miss the window.&quot;</span>
<span>Tenenga was dressed in armor and so was her sister at whom she looked. </span>
<span>&quot;Is Jax coming?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes. Kal, Do we take her or not?&quot;</span>
<span>He signed with a nod.</span>
<span>&quot;If something, She&#39;ll get acquainted.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia looked puzzled.</span>
<span>&quot;I&#39;m going, already?&quot;</span>
<span>Jax was waiting for them outside. He had a rifle and a barrel of grenades. He looked excited.</span>
<span>&quot;Alright ladies, kiddo, are you ready for your first adventure?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;This is not a hike Jax.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;And not our first.&quot; Tenenga came around with the assist.</span>
<span>&quot;Someones grumpy.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Realistic okay.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Not much realism in this world wouldn&#39;t you say Z. How are you liking your new body baby girl?&quot; Jax was impressed by Lexias quick adaptation to the range.</span>
<span>&quot;Its alright. feels...big. And I have breasts.&quot;</span>
<span>Jax laughed as he juggled an inappropriate joke in his mind.</span>
<span>&quot;Jax! Did you get the cannisters?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes Z I did.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Good, go help Tenenga get ready. Lexia, come here.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia strapped the shotgun around her waist as Zola assisted.</span>
<span>&quot;When we walk in, we will be going down for about eleven hours, when the clock shifts, the Core turns cold, and your first demon will appear. Only you can kill it. We still don&#39;t know what it looks like, but it most likely will be a Zanimus, aim for the head. Like we all do.  How you fear most for them to appear, thats how they will. That means, don&#39;t fear them coming up from behind, or else they might. Your confidence and preparation will force them to come from afar. Be sure of yourself at all times. Imagine you hunting them, not the other way around. You&#39;re the hayena. Okay?&quot; Lexia nodded. Jax came back with a couple healing bottles of hydro colloid gels and disinfectant herbs. Nothing the real world has ever seen. </span></p><p><span>They arrive at the hole when many have already left. There was small camp set up by the gates.</span>
<span>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be with Ten all the time behind us.&quot;</span>
<span>Tenenga grabbed her hand.</span>
<span>&quot;This is my second time. Zola did a run without me to find the best path. This time its different.&quot; She pinched Lexia smoothly. They dropped in the ladder to the first platform. You couldn&#39;t see much but little goblets of fire till they disappeared into the swirling tunnel scheme.</span></p><p><span>The hole descended straight down into the underworlds core one thousand miles below the surface. When the core cools down, the gas begins to evaporate through the main channel. However the release of toxic gas did not allow for sages to travel straight down the stair case and ladders all the time.  All Sages had to take cover routes, tunnels, where the doors hatched behind to prevent the smoke from getting in. A hatch opened meant the specific tunnel could be contaminated. Every couple miles the tunnels reconnected back with the main hole. The built structure was ancient, no one knew how old it was except that it was still standing after centuries of battle. The platforms built by previous Sages to their advantage lay traps for demons, it was the best terrain for fighting. Anywhere inside the narrow tunnels one could get lost and that meant easier pray. The real problem was, everyone that got to the second to last platform always made it to the core, so no one knows what it looks like. No one even knows if there is a cave like room. There are multiple staircases going alongside the hole spiraling down. However the gas has weakened the structures, and many fell into the death pit.</span></p><p><span>The blood on the walls glowed from dried up crust, the typical walls of Indiana Jones as Jax likes to put it. They passed the third door with the hatch and had little time left before the eleventh hour hit. Zola opened it and they went in with Jax closing the hatch behind them. The air got colder and Lexia felt the walls closing in on her. She kept her pace steady right behind Zola.</span>
<span>&quot;Lex, we will be expecting them soon. Like I said, aim for the head.&quot;</span>
<span>They kept walking till they reached a slope with a couple ropes dangling beside. Zola made the first descent following with her sister. Lexia was anxious, she lost pace of her breathing which grew heavier, and she forgot how to walk. Like every step she made was unnatural, she felt very tight down, fear grew. The ground plates began shaking and the stream of gas exploded behind the closed door. The sound of the gas was of a horrific hurricane. Suddenly Tenenga was surprised by a claw coming out the dirt and fired. Her Zanimus appeared, Zola was watching her closely as Tenenga exploded the heads of the first few. Jax was already on it shooting his demons. Zola still kept her eye on Tenenga. Suddenly Zolas first demon grabbed her by the legs, her worst fear, and dragged Zola towards the other two demons waiting to feast. She threw a punch and shot the one holding on to her feet in the chest. The demon stepped back enough for her to lay fire on all three, blasting them with a flame thrower. Lexia felt ambushed by mere gunshots from the front and the back. Her chest clenched and she ducked low descending on to the lower level. A hand came out of the dirt wall and grabbed her.  She shouted and backed away hitting her back against the tunnel side. The demon body was halfway out the dirt wall. The creature had no head or chest. Lexia is arachnophobic, this one definitely looked like a spider. She shot twice and missed. She fired at the top part of the body, the claw did not let go of Lexia. She fired another shot this time at the joints connecting the shoulder to the demon body. Another tentacle looking arm snapped at Lexia, this time she backed away, shot it twice in the torso and the thing stopped moving. She straighten herself and ran towards Zola and her little sister. Tenenga drew her shotgun on the last demon, blasting it into dirt ground.</span>
<span>&quot;Twenty nine! Thirty!&quot; A laud shout came from the back. It was Jax, his shooting stopped, and Lexia could hear the sound of a blade scratching the side of the rocky walls. Zolas count was twenty five, and she swiped the last demons head with a knife and tore his eyes out. The back of the trail went silent, Zola looked up at Lexia and Tenenga.</span>
<span>&quot;Where is Jax&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I heard his blade.&quot; Tenenga looked at Lexia. &quot;How was it?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;He had no face, like a spider.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;re so lucky, I love spiders.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;One of the hands was human.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;That happens. The demons usually resemble human like features because they&#39;re molded from a bunch of things you fear. You&#39;ll get used it. Once, one of the demons had my fathers face. Zola says thats normal.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;So they change?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Oh yeah. Last time I died it was because of a snake, it strangled me to death. That was my third demon.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Thirty SIX HAHA!&quot; Jax appeared behind Lexia. &quot;The last one was a charlatan, looked like my ex. Lured me in with her voice.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;We have to run now. We want to make at least a hundred miles when we open the next door.&quot; Zola started pacing at a relatively quick speed as the sound of her gun clucking back and fourth against the armor caught beat.</span></p><p><span>The sound of the gas release calmed down and the oxygen fell to normal levels. Zola opened a hatch and a few rocks fell down the steps beneath. She unclipped her carabin with the ropes and began mantling them onto the rock climbing gear. </span>
<span>&quot;We can drop down a mile before we hit the next bridge.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I thought Merch was out of buckles?&quot; Jax was surprised.</span>
<span>Zola was silent. She clipped the rope around Ten and herself, passed on another pair of carabins to Jax and Lexia. He noticed those were the same ones Zola traded to get Lexia out of trouble. Zola stole them back.</span>
<span>&quot;I guess thats why you liked the girl, you have something in common.&quot; He chuckled sheepishly.</span></p><p><span>Zola and Tenenga disappeared into the abyss first.</span>
<span>&quot;So, how did it look? The demon. was it Zanima or Zanimus?&quot; Jax was curious, everyone had their own fears, he wanted to figure out what was so special about Lex.</span>
<span>&quot;I couldn&#39;t tell. Like a spider. No head. It had human arms though.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Thats good. Animalistic shadows are less personal than human characteristics. You don&#39;t want the face of your evil wife stabbing you in the heart.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia didn&#39;t register that but Jax went on.</span>
<span>&quot;Sometimes I can&#39;t tell if its the demon or my wife.&quot; Jax laughed.</span>
<span>Lexia figured he was joking but still didn&#39;t get it.</span>
<span>&quot;Alright kiddo come here. Ill be pushing us off the side of the wall so that means keep your legs and arms close to yourself. Don&#39;t get in my way or else we will slip and I don&#39;t know if I can hold both of us for long. Got it?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Lexia forgot that she had fear of heights. The demon left a lasting impression on her face, and about a hundred feet down she realized there is nothing beneath them. </span>
<span>&quot;Don&#39;t move Lex&quot; Jax was serious. He wasn&#39;t fond of heights either. Lexia closed her eyes. They finally got to the fifth platform level where Zola and Tenenga were waiting. The light from above was coming to an end. The fog in the air blocked it and if it weren&#39;t for the ancient structures protecting the torches from dying, they would be in pitch darkness.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We have little over an hour. We&#39;re taking the staircase.&quot; The rope came crushing in front of Zola.</span>
<span>On the other side of the hole the tunnel leads to the big gymnasium sized room. There they have an opened terrain where they can spot the demons coming from all sides. Its about an hours trip to get there. They entered the next door following Zola. About thirty minutes passed and they reached a cross section.</span>
<span>&quot;Left or right?&quot; Jax was leading this time. Zola was paranoid someone was following them. It couldn&#39;t be a demon, and she knew she had the only relic on ELucid. Other OKAs were lost somewhere in the tunnels, or were in other cities being fought over. Suddenly, a light breeze flew by the Sages. </span>
<span>&quot;Jax.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;What.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Did you close the hatch?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Of course. Dont worry this must be left over from when we were coming in.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;That doesn&#39;t even make sense.&quot; Tenenga was taking jabs at Jax the whole thirty minutes. </span>
<span>&quot;Jax. You didn&#39;t close the door.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I did.&quot;</span>
<span>Another breeze flew by them.</span>
<span>&quot;Damn it Jax. Get them to the platform. One job Jax, one freaking job!&quot; </span>
<span>Zola has exactly thirty minutes to get to the door before the core shifts. They&#39;ve been running all this time. Now she had to run faster.</span>
<span>&quot;Wait!&quot; Tenenga ran after Zola. Jax grabbed her and lifted her in the air. </span>
<span>&quot;Get them to the platform Jax.&quot; She looked at her little sister. &quot;Ill fight them in the tunnels. Ive done it before.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;But you got twenty six!&quot; Ten was crying and kicking.</span>
<span>&quot;Jax!&quot; He began backing away with Tenenga in his hands. Zola looked at Lexia and handed her the relic. </span>
<span>&quot;Give this to Jax. Make sure he uses it on Tenenga if he has too. Got it?&quot; </span>
<span>Lexia nodded. She froze for a second. Zola disappeared into a run. </span>
<span>&quot;Lets go kiddo.&quot; Jax yelled at Lexia while walking away and wrestling Tenenga.</span>
<span>Lexia looked at the relic. She could fight two demons, wasn&#39;t as bad as what she seen Zola face. Lexia looked at Jax with his arms around Tenenga. She looked at where Zola was standing just seconds ago.</span>
<span>&quot;Lex! Oh bloody hell.&quot; Jax had to keep the promise to Zola. Plus, he knew they had a strong advantage in the center of the platform. &quot;Lex! Ah. She&#39;s not coming back.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Let me go you old twig!&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I can&#39;t honey bear you know that. Ill keep you tied till we reach the platform. Zola will be fine, I guess she has Lex now.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Zola was running fast, very fast. She needed to catch up to the door before the gas leaked in. Once the core shifts, she has about five minutes, if she&#39;s lucky, before the first demons appear. Lexia was about fifty feet behind her. The door was wide open and the wind was knocking it back and fourth, and Zola could see it. She felt presence behind her and ducked to the side of the wall. Demons aren&#39;t out yet, relic is with Lexia. She swung a left upper kick to Lexes chest sending her down to the dirt.</span>
<span>&quot;Lex what the hell?!&quot;</span>
<span>Gasping for air. &quot;It wasn&#39;t fair to leave you by yourself.&quot; </span>
<span>The ground shook and the core began shifting. The door was about hundred feet away. Zola charged at it. It takes two minutes for gas to reach the surface. That meant about a minute and forty seconds to reach their level. Just as the sound of the pressure got lauder, Zola locked the hatch. </span>
<span>&quot;Behind me! now.&quot; Zola drew her flame thrower. </span>
<span>&quot;Keep your distance. And don&#39;t shoot me by mistake.&quot;</span>
<span>Zola began walking slowly back. With her torch gun up she was scouting the front from where they came. She turned around to look at Lexia.</span>
<span>&quot;Behind you!&quot; Lexias demon appeared first. She turned around and fired at the legs. This time the demon had a human face. It fell to its knees and then ascended into an aggressive crawling position running on all fours towards Lexia. She fired another round this time blowing off the top of the forehead. The demon slowed down but kept charging. She shot two more times hitting the neck and left shoulder. The tunnel lit up in bright red, Zola was frying the first few of her demons. Lexia was shaking frightened. She ran towards Zola when the second demon dug out from above her and grabbed her head. Her feet lifted above the ground, she pulled out her knife and sliced the demons arm. His mouth was opened with saliva dripping on to her head. The other claw was still holding on to her hair. She lifted the shotgun vertically straight up and fired into the demons open mouth. The tunnels were lit up by the demons that caught fire under Zolas torch. They were closing in on her, with left leg still imprisoned. Zolas arms were about to be shackled by two smaller demons and four more were approaching from both the front and back. Lexia couldn&#39;t do anything but stare and listen to Zolas sounds of shrieking and heavy breathing. Four legged creature hurled by Lexia without notice jumping onto the congested pile of slithering beasts. Lexia counted eight in total. </span>
<span>Lexia was holding the OKA in her hands, it was a cylinder like relic with a stone inside that glowed.</span>
<span>Zola reloaded her flame thrower canister and this time she did not spare her own leg. She lit the coming on demon and the three behind him. The pain of her burning flesh only boosted Zolas adrenaline. She went into total rage. BLowing the burned demons. She pulled out her shotgun from her lower waist and fired three bullets into the four legged creature and two more. All head shots. She regained momentum. </span>
<span>Two demons were running from afar, both on each side of the wall crawling like spiders. Zola waited for them to reach closer, she began running like it was a game of chicken. She slid underneath firing two shots in the necks of both beastings. One fell off. The other one shrieked, jumped off and turned around. She pulled out a blade and stuck it into the gaping hole in the neck. A third demon jumped from underneath Lexia, three more followed.</span>
<span>&quot;Run with me!&quot;</span>
<span>They ascended back towards the tunnel in direction of the platform. Lexia was running parallel with Zolas demons, about twenty feet away. They were very scruffy, some one eyed, blood dredged. The one on the right had a human hand with a ring on the wedding finger. The ones in the very back seemed calmer Lexia thought. Turns out demons say a lot about her new friend. Zola could keep running but eventually she will be drained before reaching the platform. She better save her energy for fighting off the rest Lexia thought. Zola stopped at a wider intersection where the tunnel split. She turned around and waited for the demons. One was missing. Demon hand crawled out of the ground beneath her catching her foot, its always the feet she thought. He bit into the burned scar, she yelled in agony while blowing his entire torso separating his top from his lower body. She shook him off just in time for the other three. Two splicings of the blade signaled two dead, the last one was mid air with his jaw opened about to bite into Zola when the shotgun blasted. She fell back releasing weight of her left leg. Curled up on the ground she squeezed her wound as tight as she could. The shriek of her pain was heard by anyone on the surface by the gates, Lexia was sure of it.</span>
<span>Lexia wrapped a piece of cloth and squeezed hard around the wound.</span>
<span>&quot;Lift me.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Tenenga was done with her count, it seems she used the open space to her advantage. Very few reached the center leaving Ten with  barely any wounds. Jax was on his last Zanima demon when Lexia and Zola began hearing the sounds of his blades getting louder. </span>
<span>&quot;Zola!&quot; Tenenga ran towards them giving Zola and Lexia a big hug.</span>
<span>&quot;I&#39;m fine, Do you have the hydropaste?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;re burned! Jax does wait a second.&quot;</span>
<span>Jax was catching his breath. He&#39;s been bitten in the shoulder pretty badly. </span>
<span>&quot;Reach in my pocket.&quot; His breathing was regaining momentum. &quot;Lex come here, help me bandage this up.&quot;</span>
<span>Lex lay Zola on the ground by the wall. Tenenga took over. Jax had her stitch up the wounds while he chewed up the last piece of his rubber.</span>
<span>&quot;What happened to Z&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Badly burned, she lit her leg on fire.&quot; He chuckled.</span>
<span>&quot;The cylinder spirits in that bottle heal in hours.&quot; They really do. Zolas third degree burn was getting better. They all sat back for a second.</span>
<span>&quot;Jax. I saw a phantom.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Phantom?&quot;</span>
<span>Zola looked at Jax concerned. </span>
<span>&quot;Yeah, the shadow on one of the demons was neither male or female. It had a blue ivy halo around its neck.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Halo, huh, did you see something?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;No. Only that it didn&#39;t charge at me. Instead it gave out orders. It was the last one to attack.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Oh, so they communicate on this level too.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I guess. Lets go. We got to make it to the next platform.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;We wont, this one is to far everyone knows it. Better to pick the wider tunnels with no platform.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;We will make it.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Please tell me how?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Ropes.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;My shoulder is screwed. I wont be able to carry Lex.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;This time Tenenga will take Lex, my burn will be healed by the time we reach the hole. I&#39;ll take you.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Me? I&#39;m to fat.&quot; He slammed his six pack. He wasn&#39;t fat. But they knew that he had a fat belly on earth. One could tell by his mannerism, he stuffs his mouth all day long and says preposterous things.</span>
<span>They got to the hole, descended two miles below to the next door leading into a steep tunnel. All tunnels go down, and many have stair cases or land slides that go on for miles. Sages have developed sled like armor for passages that require lots of downhill sliding. This time Zola made sure the hatch was properly closed, and they began their descend into the tunnel in search for the right turn to the first downhill slide.</span>
<span>&quot;Zola?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Why are some demons boys and some girls? And why did one of them have a wedding ring?&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia was beginning to wonder how the demons change as they go deeper.</span>
<span>&quot;The demons we encounter stem from our unconscious part of the self. Zanima are projections of female demons and are found most common in the opposite sex.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I dont think she&#39;ll get it.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Look at it like this. If you are a girl. Most of your demons will be Zanimus, your subconscious representations of man in demon form. Specifically men from bad times.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;The last one looked like my father.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes, some will look like your father, could be your son that you don&#39;t have, or your husband. Like me, the wedding ring you saw was my ex husband. I had some good times with him, but mostly bad. His shadow on Zanimus appears a lot.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;So if I see my son, can I see the future?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;No. These are projections of what your unconscious self create of your son, through imagination. Essentially, unconscious shadow is made from representations of your son, father, husband or brother. Or of daughter, wife, mother and sister. Thats why the shadows of the demons switch. The shadow makes it personal and carnivorous. Otherwise the demons aren&#39;t that bad in theory. They&#39;re just projections of the negative parts inside you.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Aren&#39;t that bad.&quot; Jax mocked in disagreement. &quot;In the real world people sometimes find stuff they don&#39;t want to. And it ruins their Sunday!&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Day, not life.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Well...&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia didn&#39;t want them to get into another dispute.</span>
<span>&quot;So that means Jax sees mostly Zanima?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes kiddo, like I said, I fight my wife a lot, sometimes my mother.&quot; He exhaled slowly. &quot;mostly my wife. She was the .... ah never mind. but if I see my daughters shadow again, well I don&#39;t know if I can kill it. I mean I can. But it really sucks. It really does...&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You have a daughter?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes. I&#39;m 64.&quot;</span>
<span>That shut Lexia for a second. She looked down.</span>
<span>&quot;I still don&#39;t get the shadows.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Shadows add a personal touch to the demon. Otherwise they are the same for all people. Embedded deep in our instinct. By definition, the younger and less developed you are, the less complex and scary the shadow appears on the demon. But again, when you&#39;re ten or whatever, everything is scary.</span>
<span>&quot;I&#39;m not scared.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Good. Still a long way ahead.&quot;</span></p><p><span>They got to an intersection, the tunnel on the right was at a steeper slope. They kept walking when Lexia noticed the ground transforming into mushy mud clay. &quot;There&#39;s water.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Put these on.&quot; Zola had a pair for all four of them. A knuckle breaker shaped claws that slid on like gloves. &quot;Control your speed with these. You can also use them for demons but I wouldn&#39;t suggest. They go weary on the knuckles quick.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;How long is the slide.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Pretty long. I heard stories of Sages sliding for hours.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;What?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</span>
<span>Tenenga was in disbelief. She punched into the wall to measure the reliability of the knuckle claws. The walls shook, everything above and below did.</span>
<span>&quot;What did you do&quot; For the first time Jax looked scared.</span>
<span>&quot;I don&#39;t know, it wasn&#39;t me.&quot;</span>
<span>The sound of the gas evaporating began to increase.</span>
<span>&quot;THE CORE!&quot; Lexia yelled.</span>
<span>&quot;I thought you had the clock running Z!&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I did, we still have three more hours.&quot;</span>
<span>Jaxes Zanima appeared. So did Tenengas Zanimus. He fired two shots. Two more came out. He ran for the slide and dived. </span>
<span>&quot;Go go go!&quot; Zola was yelling ferociously. Tenenga jumped in soon followed by Lexia, the slide turned violently into a steep ramp.</span></p><p><span>Zola turned around to find her Zanimus mid air. The demon tackled her sweeping the ground from underneath her. She shanked him in the gut, stuck out her blade and swung cutting the second demon, this time a Zanima. The female demons tend to be stronger and harder to kill, they are very rare among the same gender of Sages. The beast didn&#39;t budge after the upper body cut, its claws as big as Zolas head came crashing on her. She released the trigger on the shotgun ripping the leg off. A forward kick in the gut and two shots in the chest. The beast was crippled, half alive shrieking. Zola plunged into the slide head first, the speed went from zero to a hundred really quick, and the demon didn&#39;t hesitate to follow. Sliding backwards Zola sent consecutive blasts putting the Zanima to sleep. All of the other demons began crowding around the top of the slide trying to violently get in on the race. Jax on the opposite side of the group had his blade out as he was gaining momentum on the slope, slicing off any parts of the demons that appeared out of the walls and ceiling in front and above. They were falling fast, and the slope only got steeper.</span>
<span>&quot;The bloody things are coming out the dirt.&quot; He was yelling. So was Lexia. None could hear each other.</span>
<span>Jax realized the demons can come out of the ground and cludder the slide leading to a reverse domino effect. He clocked his shotgun and pointed straight in front. Waiting. They were going fast with water levels rising while pouring alongside. Tenenga and Lexia couldn&#39;t see, a stream of on going mud mixed with Zanima blood was splashing into their face. Suddenly Lexias first demon head appeared in front of her coming out of the ground. She hit it without even noticing, ripping its head of. She lost speed and Zola was catching up. The demon remained alive. Its body came out fully straight into a crawling position. Not only did the demon gain momentum but its hands and legs were working overtime. She soon had him on her tail, the left paw grabbed on to her head. She squeaked. She was searching for her blade but couldn&#39;t pin point where it was. She began clobbering with her knuckle claws the bests hand. She missed and hit the mud. The demon pulled her in. She felt her blade slide into her gut, quickly grabbed it and stabbed the hand. The demon shrieked. Blinded by the stream of mud in her face, she jabbed into abyss. She threw her shotgun to the side, attached with a strap over her shoulder, rolled over onto her stomach, clocked it and shot. The shrieking of the demon stopped. She had two more demons to go, and they were going to appear any second now. The speed at which she was going was just as frightening as the demons.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>\/For those summoned into the collective unconscious, the Deros and</span>
<span>\/Zogos do not constitute the greatest of all threats. One must search</span>
<span>\/deeper, into the undocumented territories of the unconscious, to</span>
<span>\/find the evil that poisons the self, more dangerous than any Zanima or Zanimus</span>
<span>\/ever known to being, and it must not kill it, but liberate it from</span>
<span>\/the shackles of its own imagination.\/</span></p><p><span>Its own imagination, Kalgard was in deep thought. Droplets of rain appeared on the page of the passage, sticking the pages of the rugged down green book. Rain is nice when the sun never goes down. It lay a timid silk upon the city. Kalgaard wondered if Zola could make it this time to the core with her sister. None of them have appeared at the city square, all hopes aside, he wondered where Lexia will wake, will she transcend her own reality. The foxes stood up, the ground shook again, the hole heard screams.</span></p><hr /><p><span>Zola was falling backward head first while reloading. </span>
<span>Seven, eight, nine, she was counting decapitated heads. She wouldn&#39;t make it to the end of the ramp with the total count dead, that meant Jax was going to continue the battle at the end of the slope. Lexia would definitely be done. Tenengas demon count was nine and she was drawing on her sixth Zanimus. The head of her fathers shadow appeared from above the ceiling ten feet in front. The mouth opened as wide as the sharks jaw, about to snap she dug her left fist into the mud slowing her speed, as she neared the beasts head she pointed the gun straight up. The demons arm appeared swinging across the tunnel. The head slammed into her with its jaw wide opened. The muscles remained autonomous biting into her side torso as she dislocated the head from the rest of the body. She elbowed it consecutively till the release of the jaw loosed the grip on her torse. The swelling started. </span></p><p><span>&quot;DIE YOU SUCKERS!!&quot; Jax was blasting shots center down. Four demons were clogging the sloped tunnel twenty feet ahead. He was seconds from direct impact. He released shots after shots, blood mud smashing violently in his face. &quot;AHHHH!!!&quot; He tore a hole through the first two, hitting the ones behind and taking them with. The first one in front dug his claws onto his thighs. He face kicked the demon, keeping him from pulling closer to the opened jaw. They were regaining lost speed and the tunnel walls were closing in on them. He had to get rid of the demons or else they would get clogged. He grabbed his blade with two hands, turned it upside down and stuck it deep in the demons skull. He pulled out and stuck it again. He kicked away accelerating the dead Zanima. Staring twenty inches away from the ceiling, Tenengas claustrophobia kicked in. The slope became narrow and more vertical as they slid. It felt like Jax was about to puke his stomach out his mouth. He descended into a free fall, hitting his front this time against the ceiling, which ever way you look at it. Tenenga soon followed, there was nothing below her, they were free falling straight to the core. </span>
<span>Zola was upside down, quiet. </span>
<span>&quot;ZOLA YOU DID NOT MENTION THIS PART!!!!!!!&quot; </span>
<span>Of course no one heard it but congested sounds of demon shrieks and blood water stream bathed in mud. If Jax bites his claws into the walls, he would be killed by the impact coming from Tenenga. He just hoped the tunnel smoothed into a slippery ramp slide. And of course it did. Sages used this path for centuries. Known to the city as the local slide and die roller coaster. Some found it fun, some took longer routes that took days just to avoid it. It cut through about thirty miles of altitude. The drop smoothed out, and Jax could feel his back touching the slide again. As the slope began taking shape, all four of them were back to a steep angular position. Mind you, it was pitch dark in the tunnel, from time to time their headlights shined light but it was mostly blocked by the splashing mud. The angle of the slope eased out, and Jax was the first one to be spat out like a skimping rock on water. He bounced off the water five times before soaking himself in a pool of water. The platform was quite large and impressive in structure. Cave like dome that looked like a Russian mud bath spa center. There were actual columns on the side, and the pool was at least a hundred feet long. The end had another tunnel, it descended downward following a stream of fluid mud. Tenenga flew out at enormous speed, skimping alongside the water and almost reaching the end of the pool. Lexias scream was nearing. She flew out skimping the pool, but her speed seemed to stay the same. She skimped into the next tunnel ahead. Zola came out smashing her head into the water turning her skimp into a tumble followed by three demons. She drew her shotgun and fired. The other two pushed her under water. One of the demons gripped her neck. Her struggle to kick the demon off was reminiscent of the kicking and punching in her dreams. The second demon threw himself at splashing water.</span>
<span>Tenenga was worried. &quot;The relic! Jax!&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Lex has it. But where are my demons?&quot;</span>
<span>He counted thirty five. They were supposed to appear already. Two Zanima demons jumped out of the mud pool, he went for a forward kick, elbowing the second Zanima in the head. Tenenga dived in trying to push Zola up but the rules are simple. There is no contact between two Sages when one Sage is in contact with a Demon. Ten was pushed away by a gravitational force. That caused for water to clear between her and Zola for a second. Zola&#39;s head stuck out and she inhaled. Kneed the demon pushing him off. She drew her blade and stuck it pinning Zanimus to the bottom of the pool. The second demon jumped on her she turned the blade around and stuck it backward, pinching the demons chest then ripping it sideways. She regained her breath. Jax was tied to the wall with the demon holding a tight grip. He swiped the blade cutting the thigh, then across the chest. Zanima blood splattered on his face. Tenenga helped Zola get out of the water. </span>
<span>&quot;Wait. I think there is one more.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;We dont have much time Zola. Lex is in the other tunnel, she came down without stopping.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I dont know if I can do that again girls&quot; Jax had enough. He wasn&#39;t ready for the free fall, he was sure he wouldn&#39;t do it again.</span>
<span>&quot;Ten just take Jax and go. Ill wait for the last demon.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Easy kill for you.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Go find her. Thats an order.&quot;</span>
<span>Tenenga looked at her sister but there was no time to argue. And she was right, if they split up then Lexia is on her own. She wont make it.</span>
<span>&quot;Fine. lets go Jax.&quot;</span>
<span>Jax went by Zola towards the tunnel slide.</span>
<span>&quot;So we giving out orders now?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;OKA, Jax. remember.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Oh right.&quot;</span>
<span>Jax and Tenenga got in. Zola looked around waiting for the Demon, scouting.</span>
<span>Two minutes passed and the demon didn&#39;t appear.</span>
<span>Maybe she miscounted, she thought. She started from the beginning remembering each one. As she was nearing the end, A Zanima swooped from underneath the water. Specifically, her sisters shadow jumped out reaching for her legs. She backed off, the second hand came flying for her legs again. She jumped towards the tunnel shooting the demon. It turned around yelling in agony. </span>
<span>&quot;Oh jheez&quot;</span>
<span>She plunged at Zola who let it get close, and stuck the shotgun to the chin of Tenengas shadow head, pow. The blast pushed Zola back into the pool. The current caught her and off she fell along with others. At least they had nothing to worry about. Now, it was crucial to find Lexia. And Zola wondered if her demons appeared delayed as well. </span></p><p><span>The ride was not that bad. The ending was. The slope finished off with the stream falling approximately hundred feet below. Zola flew out yelling. Coming out the pool she found Tenenga treating Lexias wound. A knife stab in the gut, and Jax was gone.</span>
<span>&quot;Lexia!&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I&#39;m fine. Ten says the herbs will heal it fast.&quot;</span>
<span>Zola half smiled. &quot;Jax?&quot; Quickly turned into disbelief.</span>
<span>&quot;No. When I came crashing down, the OKA fell out. There were other Sages from ELucid. One of them stabbed me when we wrestled over the relic.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;They ran that way, Jax is hunting them.&quot; Tenenga pointed towards the two tunnels under the waterfall.</span>
<span>&quot;I&#39;m sorry Z.. I tried to protect it but...&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Can you walk?&quot; Zola looked irritated but was glad to see Lexia. &quot;We need to help Jax.&quot; </span>
<span>The two sisters pulled Lexia up shoulder to shoulder.</span>
<span>&quot;Ten, how were the last demons?&quot; Zola had doubts whether her sister was ready for the second half of the trip. The relic was all she relied on. Then she remembered the encounter with the last Zanima with Tenengas shadow, wasn&#39;t as strong as other female demons. Zolas subconscious projections deem her little sister weak, maybe Tenenga wasn&#39;t weak, it was Zolas inferiority that was the issue. How could she not see her sisters value?</span>
<span>&quot;I&#39;m getting better. I get Dads shadow a lot.. I miss him.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yeah...me too.&quot; Zola fell into silence.</span>
<span>The three descended into the tunnel behind the waterfall. The air was less humid and the ground dried up. They must be closer to the hole, Zola thought. An hour on the trail with no sign of Jax left the girls in a worrisome state. Lexias swelling went down, and now only Tenenga was assisting. Zola pealed off dirt from the flame thrower as the relatively strong wind breeze swept it away. Someone opened the door to the tunnel Zola figured. She signaled for the girls to keep a safe pace behind.</span></p><p><span>Jax had one of the Sages hanging beneath him. He was holding on to the rope threatening to let go.</span>
<span>&quot;Where is it?&quot; </span>
<span>&quot;I don&#39;t know, Phaz took it.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Was he the one that stabbed Lex?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I don&#39;t know dude I cant breathe&quot;</span>
<span>Jax lowered the rope again. </span>
<span>&quot;I can signal them. I have a pager.&quot;</span>
<span>And lure them in? Jax considered the idea but there wasn&#39;t much time left befoer they were out of reach.</span>
<span>&quot;Jax what are you doing?&quot; Zola ran through the door coming out into the spiral stairwell of the hole.</span>
<span>&quot;These bastards stole OKA from Lex and then stabbed her!&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I know. Does he have it.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;No, but his friends do.&quot;</span>
<span>The sound of another hatch twisting came from down beneath. They looked down and saw two Sages appear unaware.</span>
<span>&quot;Phaz!&quot; The Sage was struggling to hold onto the rope dangling. &quot; Give them the OKA!&quot;  The two below froze in surprise.</span>
<span>&quot;Sorry Mike.&quot; They began running down the stairs going for the next door on the other side of the hole. </span>
<span>Jax swung Micheal to the left, then to the right gaining a pendulum momentum. As the two betrayed their friend and ran towards the door, which was exactly couple hundred feet below where Micheal was being swung, Jax released him aiming for their heads. Zola attached her carabin to the hatch, tied a double knot and lowered herself. Pavel was graciously rejoined with his friends when he slammed on top of the first Sage smashing his head against the stair. Unfortunately his skull opened and his body turned to crust and began decaying into ash. The impact threw the Sage off balance. Phaz was helping him get up when Zola coming down pushed herself of the wall once more swinging straight above Phazes head. A nasty kick in the head shoved them tumbling down the steps in front of the door. Zola released the tension of the rope stomping between Phaz and the metal hatch entrance. </span>
<span>&quot;Give me it.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You killed the man that had it!&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Oh please.&quot; She clocked the shotgun. There was about seven feet distance between the two with Phaz and his friend next to the edge. </span>
<span>&quot;Fine.&quot; She turned ninety degrees with the shotgun inches away from Phazes friends face. </span>
<span>&quot;If your buddy goes. You have no one to use the OKA on.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;She&#39;s right Phaz.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. If I die I wake with the relic back on the square.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Why waste the trip?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;We didn&#39;t stand a chance anyway. I need better armor. And a better team.&quot;</span>
<span>Zola looked at the Sage by the edge. &quot;Thats who you call your friend?&quot;</span>
<span>The Sage forgot about the shotgun in his face, he plunged at Phaz furiously. Face bulging red, he delivered a punch after punch hitting sometimes the stone behind.</span>
<span>&quot;OY! Give me the damn relic.&quot;</span>
<span>Phaz was smeared in blood. Zola noticed the relic sticking out of his armor, she grabbed it while she saw the chance. Phaz pushed the Sage off him and drew his gun. Before he was able to fire at his team mate Zola sent the charlatan down the hole into pitch oblivion. His scream slowly disappeared into the darkness as well.</span>
<span>&quot;How old was he?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Twenty five, or so he claims.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Nonsense, that was a child, and you let him outwit you.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I&#39;m eighteen... So we believed him...&quot; The Sage looked up at Jax and the girls. &quot;Can I come with?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;No.&quot; Zola opened the hatch into the next tunnel. </span>
<span>&quot;I think we ought to give him a chance.&quot; Tenengas sympathy grew when he was betrayed by Phaz.&quot;Whats your name?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Jona&quot; His eyes glistened.</span><br/><span>&quot;Get in Ten. We don&#39;t have much time.&quot;</span>
<span>Lex went in. Jax followed. Tenenga stood there looking at Zola. </span>
<span>&quot;He&#39;s coming with.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Not now Ten.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;He is coming with.&quot;</span>
<span>Zola stuck the shotgun to his face again. &quot;You walk in front of me at all times. One screw up and I&#39;ll drop you like your friend.&quot; She signaled with the gun to get in the door. &quot;One more thing. Stay out of Lexias way.&quot; Zola did not fear him, she thought he was to pathetic to stay with the group. Jonas head tilted downward. </span>
<span>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span>
<span>Tenenga jumped up circling Zola.</span>
<span>&quot;Ill take care of him.&quot;</span>
<span>Zola span the metal door hatch clockwise, click. Darkness prevailed.</span></p><p><span>Chapter 2</span>
<span>Phaz appeared back on the square. Even though one regains life after death on this world, getting killed is still not a pleasurable process. His head was pulsating, as if the thalamus was expanding squishing the seven cortex layers into a fast food burger. As he regained his vision, the pounding of the blacksmiths metal welding stool sent his sound receptors through the skull, guess his hearing was back too. The day was normal as usual, a heat stroke after two minutes if it was Earth. The market was booming. Sages passing by with weapons to trade. Foxes sniffing around baskets of ammunition. A workshop sawing what looked like parachutes. The city of ELucid never sleeps, the one place other than New York thats eternal.</span></p><p><span>Phaz still had the blade on him, but his shotgun was gone. He must&#39;ve lost it while falling. He needed new gear, a new team, and the parachute didn&#39;t seem like a bad idea. He pushed the door walking into the busy tavern and lay all his belongings on the table. </span>
<span>&quot;How much you want for the hyper boost deezyes pair?&quot;  Immediately a Sage spotted the pair of  electric hyper boost deezyes shoes that double the normal running speed. The battery is self recharging, built from electrodes and lithium glass electrolytes between two different metals. The pressure on electrolyte feeds both electrodes with lithium ions. The composed capacitors store energy and align the Ferni levels within the device, not allowing for the shoes to catch fire and burning your toes. Depending on the intended movement of the Sage, he or she can clear twice the range of one running foot step, or twice the hight of a jump with a programmable spring. An average Sage can clear thirty miles an hour. With the hyper boost deezyess at sixty miles an hour you cut your twelve hour trip in half. The only way Phaz was giving them up was if the Sage could compensate for the potential time lost without them.</span>
<span>&quot;You got a parachute?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Really? You one of those.&quot; The guy smirked.&quot;No. But I might be able to get one for you. Can you save these for me?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;First come first serve brody.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Whats your rush? This ain&#39;t wall street.&quot;</span>
<span>A female Sage walked by without a glimpse at the table, she turned side ways and leaned against a column by where Phaz was set up. Her armor was the more rare kind with bullet proof titanium metal and sheets of melted aluminum around hollow spheres. She had it painted purple and chrome. Her tactical combat shotgun was nicely polished, Barnardelli B4 a semi automatic pump action combat shotgun, the type to make a dazzling sound when clocking, and a nasty pancake out of whoever is on the other side of the barrels. She was a pro, Phaz thought.</span>
<span>&quot;I never seen someone appear on the square so quickly just to give up every single piece they collected for trade. Whats the rush?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Well, I&#39;m not hunting just demons.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Ohhh... sounds interesting.&quot; She seemed a bit psycho, out there he thought.</span>
<span>&quot;What are you, some mercenary from earth or something?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Military, I do this for a living.&quot; French accent, French military Phaz figured. </span>
<span>&quot;And I thought there was a beauty contest for whoever had the nicest set up.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Ah you a funny boy. Tell me, who is it that you&#39;re hunting?&quot; She drew closer to the table.</span>
<span>&quot;Someone stole something of value from me. Im getting it back.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;And of what value that may be?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Sentimental.&quot; Phaz just needed to trade his gear, he wasn&#39;t interested in setting up team yet.</span>
<span>She didn&#39;t buy it. &quot;Sentimentam oh please. From where, Earth?&quot; She shrugged. Phaz hated being mocked, and he realized his white lie wasn&#39;t that imaginative.</span>
<span>&quot;What do you want?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I want to help you.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Why?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I dont know, i like you. You cute.&quot; She giggled. Phaz was suspicious of her intentions, but he needed a team either way.</span>
<span>&quot;A relic.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;A what?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;They stole Oka from me.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Ohh... with that you can do whatever, be the richest man on ELucid! or use it and waste it.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Thats what I&#39;m worried about.&quot; </span>
<span>She put her hands on the table, brought out her chest and with a giggle like smile said.</span>
<span>&quot;Okay. Tell you what. I&#39;ll assist you. We split the sale five o. I&#39;ll make you my king on ELucid.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You think I&#39;d trust you with my OKA. You&#39;ll just dump me down the hole like the last.&quot;</span>
<span>She giggled again, the thought of him flying was funny to her, and Phaz tuned back. </span>
<span>&quot;I can get to the Core any way I want. I&#39;m trained to do this, beside my demons ain&#39;t a thing. I had worse experiences on earth with humans.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;So?&quot; Phaz was confused.</span>
<span>&quot;So I like it here. I want to stay a bit before I leave. And I want to live good, besides, I&#39;ll need a king, a cute one.&quot; She giggled again.</span>
<span>She is definitely out of her mind. He thought to himself.</span>
<span>&quot;I need parachutes. They are almost nearing the second half of the hole.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;No one has ever jumped that far down, almost all splat on the side of the wall like bugs on a windshield.&quot; She thought about it. &quot;There isn&#39;t enough space to land in a spiral.&quot; She thought again. &quot;Sounds interesting.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;We need to make at least 400 miles.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;We can try.. Once we reach 120 miles per hour the speed don&#39;t change. Then we clear about 60 meters every second.&quot;</span>
<span>Phaz was okay at math. Took a couple seconds though.</span>
<span>&quot;Okay thats about 20 seconds per mile.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Everyone opens up at 100 so they don&#39;t splat but there&#39;s no point if you ask me. They either take the tunnel after, or repack and jump again. But usually the repacking is where they screw up. Rushing and all, the shute doest open or the lines are tangled. Then they splat into the sides and either break every bone in their body or just keep falling. parachutes are not worth it.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Fine. If we jump four times we might have a chance at reaching them.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;It doesnt work like that. We will reach 100 miles in 8 seconds. You&#39;re crazier then I thought.&quot; She stood there just looking at him. &quot;I like it!&quot; Then hit her fists against the table. His gear quaked. She picked up his pair of hyper boost deezyess. </span>
<span>&quot;Thats cool... Okay I gotta go do something, Ill be back here in twenty. Don&#39;t go nowhere.&quot; She threw them back on the table hitting the blade. Rude he thought.</span>
<span>&quot;Sure.&quot; Phaz was already regretting the choice he made. But a killing machine is someone you want on your team, he thought. Eh. She only increased the chances, but he needed to be extra careful when they neared the relic. During the twenty minutes Phaz was able to trade dagger knifes and star blades with custom welding for a pump action military grade shotgun and ten rounds of ammunition. Although he needed a backpack of ammunition, thats something most tend to steal. The mercenary was running late and Phaz was scouting the parameter for potential members. </span>
<span>&quot;Ripstop nylon, top breaking system of yarns.&quot; She dropped the ball of parachutes onto Phaz. &quot;Even if we get tangled up, very unlikely that the fabric will tear.&quot;</span>
<span>She sounded confident and Phaz liked that, he wasn&#39;t a base jumper, nor he ever intended to try in the first place before ELucid. But what seemed like a forceful idea has come closer to reality, and it sank in.</span>
<span>&quot;And I thought you wouldn&#39;t show up.&quot; Phaz was teasing. &quot;What do I call you?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Vice... Unless you prefer lieutenant Vicerowska if thats your thing...&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Vice is good.&quot; Phaz could barely see with the parachutes rolled up in his face.</span>
<span>&quot;We need to pack the parachute. You know how to do it right?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Umm.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You dont. Right... come with me.&quot;</span>
<span>They exited the Pawn and turned a left on the corner of an animal market, mostly dogs and foxes for sale. Some had chimpanzees with them and monkeys who were skilled in assisting with heights.</span>
<span>The kept walking passing by artillery repair shops, metal welders and sword smiths. A heat of lava metal hit Phaz in the left cheek. </span>
<span>&quot;Where are we going?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Clear territory to pack. I&#39;ll introduce you to Mike.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Mike?&quot;</span>
<span>Vice lifted the ten curtains letting Phaz through. &quot;Mike! I got someone for you.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Mickey, I&#39;m a girl Vice.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Sure. Mickey is a boy from earth, she was given a womans body on ELucid. Guess God ran out of Sages.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;There&#39;s no God and theres no bodies. I told you. This is how I always felt subconsciously. It makes sense. Now call me boy again and I&#39;ll slap that grin of your face you heard?&quot;</span>
<span>Vice backed off with her hands raised.</span>
<span>&quot;Nevertheless, she will help you with the shute. I gotta go do something. Be back soon.&quot; She tapped Phaz on the shoulder and disappeared behind the curtains. She always had something to do Phaz thought. A tall samurai type Sage walked in right after. He had to duck. &quot;Tom Hunter, here to pick up nylon silk and tobacco?&quot; A woman, unlike other Sages wasn&#39;t dressed for battle, and she seemed a bit old and scruffy looking. She passed him a duffel bag and three large leafs of tobacco.</span>
<span>&quot;What is this? V said five for five.&quot; Hunter threw the leafs on the ground. The woman ignored him and returned to her post. </span>
<span>&quot;Ill get you the two later Hunter. Get out.&quot; Vice was back. It seemed like she was running things here. Why was she interested in Phaz in the first place. </span>
<span>&quot;Why were you watching me when I appeared at the square?&quot; Phaz was suspicious of all the things Vice represented. Her motives weren&#39;t clear. But like all paranoid people, they are paranoid because deep down they aren&#39;t necessarily good themselves. Tricksters, liars, manipulators. Phaz was aware of his own hypocrisy. </span>
<span>&quot;I wasn&#39;t. I saw you at the square, then Tom called me into the tavern, five minutes later you already set up shop. Spiked my curiosity why in such a hurry. And look what I found, something worth going down for again. Did you pack?&quot; </span>
<span>Phaz was midway, the woman kept ripping the fabric out of his hands, signaling he&#39;s doing it wrong. </span></p><p><span>Vice was packed, her parachute nicely blending in with her back armor. Phaz was zipping up. They walked out of the tent and turned a right. The walls of the fortress on the left had the map carved out, next to it graffiti markings written &quot;FXXK 12&quot; &quot;God forsaken us.&quot; &quot;Trust nobody.&quot; &quot;God is dead.&quot; And so on. Phaz dwelt on the matter and since his arrival in ELucid he questioned the concept of monism severely. It became more apparaent that different realms were in hiarachical form and forever infinite so the concept of God was rather unattainable like the end of infinity. He imagined infinity being forever increasing. To his surprise gravity still exists in this world however ineverably working differently wiht the electromagnetic field not being dependent on the earth core. Phaz guessed since the same method for discovering gravity on two different realities works, then all universes must be built from the same simple laws that complex into sophisticated chaos as they grow. He believed the only thing differing were the proportions and components inside the systems. He did find it interesting that there was life born here as Kalgaards kind was. The truth of one Universe can be applied to another not discrediting any previous knowledge acquired from different realms however limited in its collective force. Kalgaards kind welcomed the new Sages upon their world in exchange for knowledge that left them impressed and sometimes entertained. His daydreaming came to an end when Tom Hunter appeared on Phazes left bumping his shoulder. </span>
<span>&quot;Who is this?&quot; Hunter looked at Vice.</span>
<span>&quot;One of our guides, we&#39;re helping him retrieve a relic stolen. Then we split the cake.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You cant split the relic, and anyway wasn&#39;t ELucid dry of them?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Not the relic stupid, profit. We&#39;re selling it.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Ohh we can get a fat..&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Who is we? You&#39;re hired. is there a problem?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Whats good the money if I decide to reach the Core?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;It&#39;s upfront.&quot; Vice threw a potato bag with coins in it.&quot;One fifty lucys.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Thats peasant money compared to the relic.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You wanna stay? I won&#39;t even ask for a refund. I&#39;ll just beat it out of you.&quot;</span>
<span>Hunter grinned. </span>
<span>&quot;Ah you never get old do you V.&quot; </span>
<span>He went off into the crowd of tents.</span>
<span>&quot;EY! You got seven hours. Meet by the hole and don&#39;t be late.&quot; </span>
<span>Vices tone deepened. One could tell she is used to giving out orders.</span>
<span>Phaz was a bit overwhelmed with Vices presence. She really was militant, more of a general than a lieutenant, at least thats what he thought. Phaz was a VR first person shooting gamer, in the top two percent of the North American region, but a kid in comparison. </span>
<span>The sound of shutters closing meant shops were being locked up. The wind whistled through creating swirls of dirt. The sky darkened and sun hid behind the clouds. Beyond the desert mountains a sand storm began forming. Vice snapped her goggles on and smiled at Phaz.</span>
<span>&quot;Calming fury.&quot; </span></p><hr /><p><span>Underworld, the group of five now made it to the next platform before the twelve hour hit again. Jonas was not that good at fighting, but he liked setting traps. He lay little detonator mines in a circle fashion six feet away from the center where he stood. Tenenga was not to far from him organizing her ammunition. Lexia was sharpening her blade, she grew fond of her technique. Her subconscious image of herself formed her into a samurai of some sort. She even changed shape, seemed older. Or so Zola thought, who was cleaning out her flame thrower and making sure she had enough fluid. Jax was on the opposite end of the platform scratching his head.</span>
<span>&quot;19 minutes.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yeah we know Jax you just counted twenty a minute ago.&quot; </span>
<span>Ten was always picking on him, but this time she meant it, she needed to focus.</span>
<span>Jonas looked over at Lexia.</span>
<span>&quot;Hey, listen, I&#39;m sorry my team mate tried to kill you. Well he didn&#39;t intend to hurt you, we just needed the relic. I&#39;m really sorry about that.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Its fine. it was out of your control&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Thanks. I feel really bad. Can I make it up to you?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;how...?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Here, switch the leather tag on the right side by the green screen.&quot; </span>
<span>Jonas tossed a grenade mine at Lexia. She caught it. Jax kept the countdown rolling in the background.</span>
<span>&quot;I don&#39;t really know how to&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Its easy. When you see a demon, press the leather switch and throw it at him. Or set it to sensitive mode and..&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;re over complicating things for her.&quot;</span>
<span>Zola interrupted.</span>
<span>&quot;Just use it like a grenade, press the button and throw. Shouldn&#39;t be that difficult.&quot; </span>
<span>Zola was still unsure of Jona. </span>
<span>&quot;10 minutes&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I&#39;ll throw it. Thanks Jonas.&quot; lexia didn&#39;t speak much. She didn&#39;t want to nor she didn&#39;t feel like explaining herself. The demons were enough to keep the mind busy. The Zanimus with the shadow of her father resembled a specific time, he was drinking heavy right after mother died. The smell of alcohol coming from the demon made her tremble in disgust. </span>
<span>&quot;9 minutes.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You know Jax you could count every five minutes, every minute is a bit pretentious wouldn&#39;t you say?&quot;</span>
<span>Ten couldn&#39;t get off him.</span>
<span>Jona sat down in a meditative position.</span>
<span>Zola made sure her semi automatic safety was off.</span>
<span>&quot;8 minutes. You know Ten, if Zola wasn&#39;t my friend I would&#39;ve traded you for that nice body armor they had at Merches shop. That chrome polish on the edges. It would&#39;ve suited me well.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia giggled.</span>
<span>&quot;Oh now you find him funny?&quot;</span>
<span>Tenenga smirked back at Lexia.</span>
<span>&quot;Well at least someone is in a better mood finally.&quot; </span>
<span>Zola was happy to see Lex smile. It gave a sense of strength to the group.</span>
<span>&quot;Five minutes. I didnt say anything on the last two.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Amazing Jax. The last five is when you should count every minute.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Oh so now you want me to count now? like Minutes? Like I was previously. Hey Ten check this out. 4 minutes. Like that?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Jax how are you fifty and behave like a seven year old. Lexia is more mature.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Any more requests?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;No.&quot;</span>
<span>They shut it. 3 minutes left. Everyone was ready, none were willing to. 2. 1. The ground shook and the sound of the gas was heard from deep behind the walls of the hole. Stillness prevailed, eyes wide open, Jonas first mine went off sending firework explosions into the ceiling. The party started.</span></p><hr /><p><span>Vice was standing above the hole. The Core just shifted and gas was about to reach them. They backed off to a safe distance. Hunter arrived looking kind of worn out. </span>
<span>&quot;Money well spent?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Oh yeah. Not all, just in case.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Gas clears in thirty. We can assume they just began battle. When levels reach normal, Hunter goes first, Phaz then me. I don&#39;t want non of you nitwits falling on my head.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;The Sage with the OKA is a woman, I think they call her Zol. There is an older man Jack. And two younger girls. The one I thought didn&#39;t speak. She might be young I don&#39;t know.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;And the girl with the relic, what does she have on her?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;A blade, shotgun and a flamethrower, its all I saw.&quot;</span>
<span>A flamethrower, that aren&#39;t that many with them, Vice remembered a girl walking around with one a few weeks back. She got the picture.</span>
<span>&quot;And the rest?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Same, blades, shotguns. oh, Jonas is with them. He didn&#39;t come up on the square yet, so they let him live I guess. He&#39;s an electric engineer student. Had a few programmable explosives and grenades on him. Jax is a big guy, likes to strangle demons with rope.&quot; That wasn&#39;t true, he just figured since one of his was caught dangling by his neck.</span>
<span>&quot;Alright. Hunter you take care of that Jack and the girls. Phaz you try to aim for Jonas since you already know him, and maybe help Tom with the girls. I saw the girl before, she&#39;s was really good at combat training. Unless Phaz you would rather take her?&quot;</span>
<span>Phaz knows what she is talking about, Zola was ruthless and skilled in technique. Her martial arts was fluid. He didn&#39;t have that kind of talent. </span>
<span>&quot;No thats fine. I&#39;ll help you out. Just, keep up to the bargain.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Are you questioning me?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Nonono, just let us know when you got the relic thats all I&#39;m saying.&quot;</span>
<span>Vice seemed somewhat offended. Her carnivorous face seemed evil, but she was a loyal troop. She considered herself a modern day hero, and fought with dignity. Gas began clearing.</span>
<span>Vice stepped above the edge.</span>
<span>&quot;Wait.&quot; Phaz was having second doubts. Hunter came up, and without a second guess jumped into the dark. </span>
<span>&quot;Wait for what?&quot; Vice caught on Phazes tone.&quot;There&#39;s no going back. It was your idea.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I know. I&#39;m just... Can you give me some tips or something.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yeah. Its pretty simple. Pull here when the speedometer reaches eighty nine.&quot; </span>
<span>Phazes face gave her some satisfaction. She touched the leather tag on his shoulder plate. Grabbed him by the straps and lifting him off the ground. </span>
<span>&quot;Ill see you down there.&quot; She smiled, and flung him off the edge. Phaz started screaming. He was falling backward and needed to level out to his front. Vice checked her speedometer one for time to see if tis working. And seconds later she followed. The three were accelerating at relatively fast pace. After twelve seconds was falling at full speed clearing 58 meters each second. Twenty seconds to clear a mile. They had 4 hundred miles to go. Two hours for Phaz to readjust his position, nothing about his armor was aerodynamic. Soon as he balanced out from left to center, the wind on his right pushed him back into a roll. Vice was directly above him watching in amusement, she figured it was very unlikely that he would make it without splatting into the side walls. So far he was doing okay, falling from left to right aggressively turning spinning around. She was chuckling until bird poop hit her face, bird poop? She wiped it off in disgust. Unfortunately to her surprise, it was worse. Phaz just puked. Every three seconds he imagined passing out, but it was only imagination.. he transitioned between yelling and puking every couple seconds.</span>
<span>Ew, She wiped herself off. </span></p><hr /><p><span>Lexia just used up her gift from Jonas on her third demon. The blast sent the Zanimus back ten feet. She was getting a hang of it. Accelerating run, then jumping above the demon to finish the kill. The blade pierced through the head with the end of the blade hitting the ground. CLING, lights out. Wind swept through shutting the fire torches dead. Everyone froze. The fire is eternal, burning through centuries of battle. A second passed and flames came up. More than twenty demons were standing scattered. Lexias Zanimus with a shadow of a young boy with bat wings crashed with its fists knocking her down. The sound of her blade disappeared behind her as it fell down. She drew her shotgun and fired. The bullets punctured the ribs and a wing, demon jumped up flying on top of her. The feet were of an eagle opening up its claws as they descended upon Lexia. She speed rolled to the side jamming a dagger knife into its foot and nailing him to the ground. She drew the gun again this time in perfect timing for the head to appear where the barrel of the gun ended. The Zanimus faced her, face was rather familiar, of a young boy that looked related, of a picture she seen in the family album. She pulled the trigger.</span></p><p><span>Zola was on her tenth demon steaming up the place. When a bunch of beasts charge at her, she usually fries them with a flame thrower killing two birds with one stone. Jax was smashing heads of the Zanima one after the other, luring them into his lasso on which he strangled their peculiar ankles. Shot after shot the demon count lowered. When terrain is leveled and spaced out, Sages don&#39;t really have trouble facing large numbers. Jax overall count was nearing the amount one would not like to find themselves at. Tenenga was six down with a shotgun in her right and a handgun in her left, she fired simultaneously killing the seventh Zanimus. A Zanima appeared behind her jabbing its claws into metallic armor and piercing it through. That sent a shock wave of icy pain through her spine. She fell on her knees dizzy, and the demon dug deeper stomping her to the ground.</span>
<span>&quot;Ten!&quot; Zola heard her yell.</span>
<span>Tenenga raised the shot gun above her head and fired. The bullet took out a portion of the Zanimas face, pushing her off of Tenengas back and detaching its claws from the rest of the demon body. The little sister was not able to tell but it seemed like it was her mothers shadow, she fired three more rounds ending the demons life. The more she sees her mother, the more resemblance in behavior of the demon, who sneaks up on her like her mother used to when she was angry with Tenenga. She wished she would&#39;ve dealt with her moms outbursts in a more adult fashion, instead they would get into fights constantly, with screams threatening Tenenga being grounded and Ten running away from home. Arguments burst out almost every day and Zola was powerless when it came to convincing mother to go easy on Tenenga, but she never did, sh expected big things from her prodigy child. </span></p><p><span>Jona returned to his circle surrounded by his favorite programmable explosive technology. He managed to send three demons into air, then his sisters shadow appeared. The flashback took him to his days in middle school when his sisters older friends used to pick on him, pushing him away from the living room when they occupied the space. He hated his sister, and never had the balls to retaliate. Unlike his previous days, he had no room to run too except to face the demon, and he finally overcome the fear of his sister and couldn&#39;t wait to return and give her the business. Most Zanima demons he fought were dumb and savage like beasts, however he encountered a more intelligent kind when fighting with his previous team. Kalgaard has educated many Sages on the matter. It is well known that as the path to the Core descends deeper into the underworld, Zanima and Zanimus become wittier luring in their prey. The deeper the underworld goes, the demons exhibit deeper parts of the mind where unexplainable fears en rooted in mans nature lay place. In Kalgaards words Jonas remembers, The Zanimus draws his sword of power - they become more technical in combat showing less savage like behavior - and the Zanima  ejects her poison of illusion and seduction. The female demon take shape of Sages mothers, sisters, daughters or wifes, and use more strategic tactics such as imitation of the loved ones, their voice or empathic behavior that allows for the beast to get close to its target. Some go crazy, some are fascinated by the realness of the illusion and give in, and some are able to pull themselves out of it and realize that what they are experiencing is not real. Jonas hated his sister. Two blows to her torso and she was down. As long as the terrain of the platform was well spread out, the Sages had a tactical advantage and soon all Demons were no more. They gathered what they had left of their arsenals and continued down a steep set of stairs towards the hole.</span></p><p><span>Zola figured it was time to explain to Lexia the second half of the underworld. Considering her age, she might be more vulnerable to developing schizophrenic symptoms after countering some of the Zanimus, especially Zanima. They prey on love, lust, and remembrance of happy memories. Truly demonic tactics, Zola feared for Tenenga as well, but if it came down to using the relic, blood over anyone else. </span>
<span>&quot;Do you remember your mother?&quot; Zolas tone was rather gentle, sincere. Something Tenenga hasn&#39;t heard in a while.</span>
<span>&quot;I guess so? But what do you mean?&quot; It came unexpected to Lexia. So much time has passed since her talk with Kalgaard, the sleepless hours, if time was the same on ELucid as it is on Earth then she would have already celebrated her tenth birthday.</span>
<span>&quot;You said its just you and your dad. When did Mom leave?&quot; Zola had to puncture through, it&#39;s just not nice to bring it up.</span>
<span>&quot;She didn&#39;t, she died of cancer when I was six.&quot; Lexias tone didn&#39;t change.</span>
<span>&quot;Oh. You didn&#39;t mention that. Do you remember how she looked before that?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes. She used to drive me to kindergarten and first grade. Then when school started, they took her to the doctors.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Do you remember her with your father?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes. They were in the kitchen always.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Did they fight?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes.&quot; Lexia was stone cold. Zola was afraid this world can make a child grow up fast. Just not that fast. Even though killing here is somewhat simulated, different touch than from Earth, it pained her to hear Lexia this calm.</span>
<span>&quot;You know we are approaching the second half of the underworld. This is where demons get more real.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia walked quiet. Tenenga couldn&#39;t keep her composure. </span>
<span>&quot;Oh Z can&#39;t you see she doesn&#39;t care anymore. No one cares as far as I&#39;m concerned. We&#39;ve been killing beasts with tentacles and goblin faces!&quot; Tenenga got near Lexias left, opposite of Zola. </span>
<span>&quot;The demons will be your mother, your father, your sisters and brothers and so on you get the point right? The main point is, its mostly your father that will look exactly like him, but you need to know that its not him. Can you promise that?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes. I know. Kalgaard said it already. I remember.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;He did? Anyway, what Zola is trying to say though is, if you see your Mother, which is very unlikely, but if you do. Some say it is impossible to resist her love.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Who says that?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Everybody! I don&#39;t know it doesn&#39;t matter, thats beside the point. You need to trust us. If you see your Mother. Do not go toward her. Do you understand?&quot; Tenenga was very persistent.</span>
<span>&quot;Yes.&quot;</span>
<span>Zola jumped back in. &quot;Its crucial that you know its not your real Mother.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes I understand. I know.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Anyway we got time before they take form. Still a couple goblins to kill.&quot; Zola nudged Tenenga with the butt plate of her flame thrower.</span>
<span>&quot;EY!&quot; The vibe was getting warmer.</span></p><hr /><p><span>Vice dived in vertically feeling immense pressure on all sides of her arrow body. The hole was pitch dark with occasional torches passing by seeing markings and blood crust dried on the walls. Phaz was skipping from left to right precipitously. After two hours of descent he learned to stabilize from abrupt turnarounds. Phaz thought why stop now if they can reach the core before the first shift appears. Why dont Sages just do that? They were nearing 450 miles of altitude and there was no sight of Hunters parachute. He wouldve opened by now Vice thought. 470 miles, no sign. She dove straight down again slamming into Phaz and grabbing onto him. &quot;OPEN AS SOON AS I LET GO OFF YOU!!&quot; He could barely hear her yelling. He nodded. She pushed off him creating distance between the two. Phaz opened the parachute, the spontaneous jolt sent him flying into the wall. He quickly pulled on the left tag steeply down. His body slammed against the wall damaging his hip. The parachute scraped aggressively against the wall tearing the corner. He pushed down his left side harder yanking the leather tag a bit to much. His lines tangled up he smashed into the wall again scraping his armor against it. With very minimal light he saw the oncoming staircase which he was about to hit and break every bone in his body. The impact into the wall turned his background untwining the lines. He regained gliding but his speed was rather fast, hitting the edge of the stair case and this time breaking his left. He cried out in pain swearing his guts out. Vice evened out her parachute turning left into an abrupt spiral glide. She watched Phaz as he tried to even out the parachute again this time hitting the other side of the hall. Luckily the down below staircase caught him sending his body into the rocky formations of stairs. With his leg shredded he echoed in pain. </span></p><hr /><p><span>Zola opened the hatch and Jonas, Tenenga, Lexia and Jax exited the narrow mud tunnels. The map read that the next platform is five hundred fifty miles from the surface. If they wanted to get there in time before the core shifts, they either lowered themselves by rope, or took the tunnel that did not have a hatch behind it. The only part of the tunnel system that is always contaminated, the hatch door was at the platform.</span>
<span>A couple rocks flew by Zola and Jonas, her face froze in disbelief, the core was about to shift. The echo of Phazes pain hit their ears. </span>
<span>&quot;Quiet, someones here.&quot; Zola signaled to lay low. &quot;Go go go&quot; They all ran for the next tunnel. Zola let them pass and stuck her flashlight out above her. It was pitch dark but the gory sound of crying still lingered. Then a body zoomed passed her with extreme speed. Swoosh, That was Hunter. His altitude meter stopped working passed 300 miles, he was relying purely on time and it seems like he didn&#39;t count it correctly. Zola looked down and before Hunter disappeared into the black hole, barely visible sight of his parachute appeared turning into a circular gliding motion. Zola signaled for everyone to get it. They started running into the darkness of the tunnel. </span></p><p><span>Vice was standing above Phaz holding onto his leg in agony.</span>
<span>&quot;SHHH Quiet. I just saw a light shine towards us.&quot;</span>
<span>She looked down, it was really far down but the light was flickering back and fourth.</span>
<span>&quot;They&#39;re here. Get up.&quot;</span>
<span>For a second she actually felt sorry for him. She unzipped her pouch and injected Phaz with pain killers. </span>
<span>&quot;You ever taken drugs?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;This is insane i cant...&quot; He was sobbing abruptly.</span>
<span>She ripped a piece of cloth and wrapped it around his knee cap squeezing it tightly. That send another jolt of pain through his left side.</span>
<span>&quot;Get up. They&#39;re getting away.&quot; </span>
<span>Vice only needed him to find them. But since their impressive landing It took her just a second to make the choice.</span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;re just going to leave me here?&quot;</span>
<span>Vice stopped and turned around.</span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;re right. Either way, I&#39;ll find you above.&quot; She straighten her arm out with the semi automatic at the end and pulled the trigger.</span></p><p><span>Zola was rushing everyone, whoever used parachutes would&#39;ve gone down straight to the core. Why stop here? Beside the point that it was a good idea but very risky, this stop seemed way to peculiar. Again, the relic held lots of value and she was the only one holding it. Somewhere five hundred miles below the surface was an underworld cave the size of a city. Ancient Sages built structures that lasted to this day. The Legend goes that the relic contains a tiny piece of stone that was once part of a large crystal cathedral. The ancient lords ruled the underworld with armies of Guards, Kalgaards ancestors, battling a collective force of demonic armies. Families protected the crystal drawing its energy from the source. Over millennial demons developed to be more sophisticated creatures and their embedded roots in unconscious nature evolved into new species called the Drahen and Dragezes. They were the first female and male demonic ancestors of Zanimus and Zanima. The ancestors overpowered the Sages and destroyed the cathedral smashing it into pieces. With that the collective power of the Sages vanished, and each Sage was left for himself to battle a new generation of demons, Zanima and Zanimus and the shadow that came with it. </span></p><p><span>The hour was nearing and they were not far from the next platform. The core was about to shift, they had a mysterious tail following them and the tunnel was soon to be contaminated with poisonous gas. Zola hasn&#39;t even thought about the Demons that were about to appear. It was crucial for the younger kids not to give into the psychosis of illusionary love and happiness. The entire road to the platform was to wide for Jonas to lay booby traps in hopes of weakening their predator. It was a waste and Jonas had only a couple programmable detonators and even less grenades. Tenenga was the first one to spot the hatch guarding the platform. It was sealed tightly, it took Jaxes help to open it. The sound of rusty bolts squeaked sending shivers down everyones spine. The platform was large, somewhat a guard post to the city and several miles below lay the ancient ruins of a city, or so Zolas map said. A massive hole the size of a crater was right in the middle of the platform, as if someone detonated a pyramid of explosive in the very center. The five Sages shined their lights and Zola threw one of the torches down the hole. There it lay, towers, houses, plazas, a big fortress half blown out guarding the remains of the cathedral. After touching ground of the city, Zola found the network of fire trails that lit up the city. The source where the cloth lay had semi black and gray ash which meant it died not long ago. The smell was still there, she signaled to lay low, a sonic sound wave blasted through the cave and a bullet pierced through Zolas shoulder. She fell to the ground, more shots fired this time scattered at the whole group. Vice was on top of the platform laying down in sniper position aiming straight down. Zola was lucky she did not light the flame. They scattered around hiding behind the ruins in dark corners, all light was dead. Vice equipped with gear, she snapped on night vision goggles but there was no sight of them, then a tiny thing appeared on her left. Zola fired three shots back scraping the bullets along the ground inches away from Vices face. Vice ducked and loaded what seemed like an arrow with cloth at the end of it. She took out a flask and spilled what seemed like flammable fluid on the fabric, stuck it on the arrow and loaded her multi functional rifle with fire. Her shot pierced straight into the source of the city light network, and the cave revealed itself. It was abnormal in size, to think something this big can be underground left Lexia more than starstruck. </span>
<span>&quot;JONA!&quot; Zola was signaling for him to pass the grenades to her. He didn&#39;t want to reveal his position, but Zolas idea was inviting. He slid the programmable grenades across the stone ground. Two sniper shots hit the wall where Jona ducked, he instructed. &quot;Pinch the toggle to the highest!&quot; </span>
<span>Zola untied the knot off her rope, an elastic piece of jumpy cord she used for amortization in case of rock climbing accident. She grabbed the grenade and ran for the tower with a set of columns in front. Jax, Lexia and Tenenga were spraying armies of bullets at Vice covering Zola. As she was at an end wrapping the bungee cord around the second column Vice spotted her and fired. Zola ducked behind letting loose of the sling shot. The others released another round of ammunition and Vice hid back behind the dust of gravel. Zola mounted the grenade on the elastic part and pulled back. Vice rolled to the seeing what Zola was up to she pulled the trigger. The cocking of the sniper gun was empty, she had to reload. Zola was pulling back as much as she could, Vice reloaded and cocked it, shot. The bullet pierced through Zolas thigh making her release the grenade a tad to early. The grenade flung at the crater. The explosion was huge however beneath Vice, sending a small turbulence and heavy rock dust into air.</span>
<span>&quot;All this work for that! HA!&quot; Vice yelled in laughter. Then the ground cracked, the explosion destroyed the entire bottom of the platform where Vice lay. Inches of stone between Vices sniper position and nothing, the floor broke. She drew her blade stabbing the side of the crater, the sword slid through the stone lowering Vice to the edge of the crater in the ceiling. Holding onto the sword she dropped her rifle hitting the roof of one of the ancient houses. Zola screamed in pain, the bullet punctured her muscle tissues and she was in deep pain. Tenega ran to treat the wound. Treachures sound of the core shifting sounded from underneath. Jax and Jona fired at Vice. Where she dangled before was now empty, only the sword remained pounded into the stone with a carabin and a line descending down from it, she lowered herself down. </span></p><p><span>With her right hand Tenenga duck with her knife into Zola wound. She shrieked, with her left hand she quickly snatched the relic from Zolas pocket unnoticed. Demons were going to appear any minute now and Zola was not ready. A few more seconds and screams and the bullet was out, Tenenga quickly bandaged it. Everyone got into position, the bullet punctured straight through her shoulder so there was nothing to fidget about. She stood up with the help of Tenenga and looked at the tower in front, they went up. Lexia was stationed not to far from Jona and Jax. Vice was on the other side of the houses and cathedral, she knew what time it was. The demons appeared from the end of the city running through blocks of alleys and rooftops. One by one the shooting began and they were taking out demons left and right before they ever got to them. Lexia and Tenenga were nearing the end, so was Jona but Jax and Zola had lots to go. Shots sounded from Vices part of town, it would keep her busy for a while Zola thought.</span></p><p><span>Chapter 3</span></p><p><span>The leaves sparkled in yellow and green brushing sideways along the whistling wind as the branches bend backward. Lexia was in the middle holding her parents hands begging to swing her up. Every Saturday they went for a walk in Central Park on the way to fifth avenue where Lexias favorite ice cream place was. Midway as they exited the park onto Columbus Circle her parents got into somewhat of rebuddle that turned into an argument. Mr. Davis took off his hat and began fidgeting with it in anger. Lexia only six years old, feared for her mother when he was angry. He always squeezes hard on a newspaper, hat or whatever it may be when deeply irritated. A scary trait Lexia found to haunt her in dreams. By the time they reached the ice cream shop, it didn&#39;t taste as good. The mother was silent brushing Lexias hair as she scooped up little spoons of strawberry cream. The father was to irritated to stay and he left. His absence eased the tension on Mrs. Davis but Lexia felt unsettled. It was when her father left after arguments that she feared most he would not come back. </span></p><p><span>Back in the underworld, Lexia just shotdown a version of a Zanimus that looked rather handsome like Jonas. She projected qualities of her new friend that both Tenenga and her found to be attractive. She didnt mind firing at the demonic shadow, the two last demons where Zanimus and Zanima. They looked more human like then the rest, Lexia could not see that far in the distance but it seemed like her parents. She stopped firing. They were hugging, yelling Lexias name. &quot;WHERE ARE YOU LEX, LEX WHERE ARE YOU.&quot; Lexia froze, she didn&#39;t expect for them to appear so vivid in their nature and so quickly. It ain&#39;t them, she thought to herself. They broke the hugand turned towards Lex, the father had peculiar things crawling on his face. He looked at the mother and pushed her off him. His walking turned into running, soon his hands mutated into muscular shaped claws and he fell on all fours. The mother followed. Lexia jumped on the edge of the terrace of the house she was on and drew her sword. They smashed into the side building tearing their claws into the stone walls. Lexia looked down, she could&#39;ve easily shot them down but she waited. Lexia wanted to see her parents from up close, atleast the demonic projection of them. Tenenga looked across from her tower staring at the sight of two demons crawling ferociously up the wall, with Lexia standing directly above them. What is she doing? Ten thought. Six feet away from her parental beasts, Lexia jumped with her blade pointing straight down. The sword sliced the father shadow dropping his body to the ground. She fell feet first onto her mothers demon taking her with. Lexia landed on the cushion of the Zanima, the demon pushed her off gently. &quot;Lex, its me baby girl.&quot; The gentle voice was spot on as her mothers. Lex wanted to say something but the sight of her mothers face half blended with a reptilian snake skin gave her chills. She wanted to do it quickly and drew her gun. The mothers voice turned to a hiss and she plunged at Lexia and the two collided after she pulled the trigger. The body of her half demonic mother fell on Lexia. Screams from the other side of the town got louder. That was Vice and it came to surprise the fear that prevailed in the voice. Lexia pushed off the dead Zanima and ran toward it. She climbed a near building and looked at the courtyard where the scream sourced from. It was Vice laying beneath three men peculiar looking half drained in demonic skin. They were biting at her when Vice tried to push them off. </span>
<span>&quot;Help!!&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia was in no power to help. Everyone knows the rules. Just thirty minutes ago Vice was trying to kill Zola, now she was crying for help. Something in Lexia hesitated before turning back. AHH. She jumped down to  push the demons away however the force field preventing collective intervention in ones fears send a wave that pushed Lexia and Vice away from one another. The push was enough for Vice to get out of underneath the three demons and she grabbed her semi automatic blowing the beasts heads off. Lexia stood up face to face with Vice.</span>
<span>&quot;Thank you. I didn&#39;t think someone heard me.&quot; </span>
<span>Lexia let the silence speak for itself. She observed Vices gear, her posture and who this woman really was.</span>
<span>&quot;Why are you trying to kill us?&quot;</span>
<span>Before Vice was able to answer two Zanimus demons appeared from Lexias right and left charging at Vice. She charged back slicing the bottom legs, ending the second Zanimus life with a blow in the neck. She turned around at where Lexia was standing but she was there no more. </span></p><p><span>Zola was still up on the tower unshaken. There was a pile of dead demons beneath her creating a nice staircase for the oncoming few. </span>
<span>&quot;I&#39;m long done with mine. How many did you count?&quot; Zola did not answer immediately over the sound of bullet shells falling to the ground and demons shrieking coming to an end. </span>
<span>&quot;Those are the last six.&quot; She pointed at the band of Zanimus demons with all various very human like shadows running in the alley. Zola reloaded the semi automatic chamber. Then farther off in the distance she saw someone by the looks of Lexia on one of the roofs. Tenenga noticed her glance. </span>
<span>&quot;Z look at the demons !&quot; Tenenga jumped onto the next roof starting off into a run. Zola wished Tenenga not to deal with the predator Sage. Zola released the entire chamber killing all six of the demons. The last one was not to far from Zola when she popped him in the forehead. She followed the trail on which Tenega descended towards Lexia. As soon as she landed on her foot she remember the pain, and that her leg was swollen from the bullet. Zola reached ground level and was rejoined by Jax. </span>
<span>&quot;I much prefer high advantage points like this. I was just sitting pecking at the little rats.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Same. We need to get to the girls, they went ahead of us to find the Sage.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I saw. You know as I shot my dead wifes and mothers I didn&#39;t feel that bad anymore. I guess I just got used it.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;re also in your fifties. They&#39;re kids.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I know. Whats the count on the Sage do you think?&quot; Zola ignored. She was struggling with jogging.</span>
<span>&quot;I got you.&quot; Jax pulled Zola up on his back and they ran towards the girls. They passed two courtyards empty and on the third one they saw Tenenga with her gun raised pointing at Vice, Lexia beside her. Vices gun in her hand lowered. </span>
<span>&quot;Its not personal. I&#39;m just merely doing my job.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;What job?&quot; Jax just let Zola down and she was cripple walking up toward Vice.</span>
<span>&quot;So you&#39;re the leader of the bunch?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;What job?&quot; Zola swore she will shoot her face first if she is forced to repeat herself. The two bullet wounds weren&#39;t necessarily inviting for a conversation.</span>
<span>&quot;You stole a relic from my client.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Client? It was a fair trade. I gave up something very few would.&quot; She must&#39;ve had someone confused.</span>
<span>&quot;My client says you robbed him on the 300th level, a few shifts back.&quot;</span>
<span>Oh, now she got it. She was talking about Phaz. </span>
<span>&quot;That little brat and his friends stole it from Lex.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Not what I heard.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Listen I couldnt care less what you heard. He tried to steal it from us, I got it back and his friend.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Friend?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Your client&quot; Zola laughed at the sound of that.&quot;Betrayed his only teammate.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Oh right he said the same about him, betrayed by his team.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;The kid is a lying rascal. He outwitted everyone, even you genius.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia and Tenenga looked at each other. Where is Jona?</span>
<span>&quot;Listen I don&#39;t want no hard feelings. I was hired to retrieve the OKA thats all.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;re not retrieving anything.&quot; Zola signaled for Jax. &quot;Rope.&quot;</span>
<span>They tied her up to a column. </span>
<span>&quot;Why not just shoot her?&quot; Jax thought it was a waste of rope.</span>
<span>&quot;She can do the parachute thing again. Which by the way is something we shoulve considered.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I mean... The tunnels become more complex as they descend deeper. I doubt she could do it ag...&quot; </span>
<span>Zola interrupted. &quot;Why take away the fun. She will learn her lesson when the demons appear. This time powerless&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Thats a bit cold.&quot;</span>
<span>Zola looked back at the gate to the courtyard. Lexia and Tenenga went to search for Jona.</span>
<span>&quot;No its not. Whats cold is her trying to blame this hole ordeal on some scrappy kid. She fooled him into believing he hired her, remember the voice yelling in pain at the hole. She probably slaughtered him once he led her to us. You know what the price of the relic is on ELucid.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;How did you figure that out?&quot; Jax was trying to follow.</span>
<span>&quot;Its cuz she would&#39;ve done the same if she didn&#39;t have, and who is it, your little sister here? I thought you looked rather familiar. Feisty too.&quot; Vice answered the question before Zola could. Two gun shots echoed from the corner of the towers. </span>
<span>With Vice tied up and unlikely to slip away, Jax helped Zola run toward the gunshots. They found Lexia and Tenenga raising their hands in forfeit, with Jona at the end of the alley cuffed into a head lock by a tall man.</span>
<span>&quot;Ill kill him. Don&#39;t test me.&quot;</span>
<span>Jax drew his gun onto the man. &quot;Give us the boy and we will let you go.&quot;</span>
<span>Tom noticed the woman from Phazes description. </span>
<span>&quot;OKA, do you have it?&quot;</span>
<span>Did he tell the entire city? Zola was understandably furious. </span>
<span>&quot;OKA? What makes you think we have it?&quot; Jax played dumb.</span>
<span>&quot;She has it&quot; Hunter pointed toward Zola. At that split second when he waived his gun Tenengas shot pierced his right shoulder, inches away from Jonas face. The shot released tension off Jona and he flailed freeing himself into escape. Lexia and Tenenga began firing and Tom Hunter ducked for cover. Lexias bullet scraped his ankle sending him face down behind a building. They grabbed Jona and started running. Jax lifted Zola up again and she signaled toward the large gate descending deeper into ground. </span></p><hr /><p><span>Phaz woke up back on the square with his leg healed, the memory of the excruciating pain still lingering in the back. Maybe she did him a favor he thought, nevertheless, he went in search of the tent where he got the parachute. </span></p><p><span>&quot;Sorry we are all out at the moment. There has been unusual growing demand for parachutes lately.&quot; The old woman replied. She was wearing a different outfit, a buttoned up shirt with blazer jacket on top. She liked her job?</span>
<span>&quot;What do you mean growing demand lately?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;A Sage appeared not long ago offering lessons how to land at fast speeds.&quot;</span>
<span>How convenient Phaz thought to himself. Maybe he can get out of this place once and for all. Screw the relic and anyone that has something to do with it.</span>
<span>&quot;But why haven&#39;t Sages used parachutes before?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;They have but very few can really make the right turn. The rest keep appearing back up.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;So? Try again till they make it.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;There isn&#39;t enough fabric to sustain such numbers. Plus, the new nylon fabric is only recent, from different parts of this land. Parachutes used to tear instantaneously, almost all did very easily I must presume.&quot; The old lady made the move to return to her post.</span>
<span>&quot;Where is this man?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Who?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;The parachute instructor&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;At the end of the market by the desert mountains. He opened up training grounds as I understand. You&#39;ll see just go there..&quot; She was on her last temperament.</span>
<span>Phaz stopped bothering her. &quot;Thank you, graciously.&quot; Graciously? Where did that come from he thought. Note to self, keep it real.</span></p><p><span>The market was filled with artillery and weapons, armor shops, clothes, wine and spirits - although none could get drunk, the shop had many potions to treat wounds and burns, some tried to drink it and nothing happened, they just pee it out - a library of sagas and stories, documented historic elements as well as acute studies of the anatomy of demons, a shop just for rope, carabins, metal wielders with variuos different craftsman ship, the engineering workshops with tons of robotics, you can do anything you want if you can build it. One Sage built himself a compact bionic jetpack but he ran out of gloserine - the equivalent of oil or fuel on Earth. Many inventors tried thousands of ways to get to the core. No matter what gadget or shortcut one may try, the old school way of doing things still remains most popular among the commons. Some Sages decided to set up nets every hundred miles but after twenty shifts the gas weakened the ropes and Sages punctured through. There had to be a more efficient way of installing the nets than by decent because once a Sage is underneath, its every man for himself, and no one really wants to be a hero. Phaz was not an inventor nor he was really looking for one, he just needed to master one of the old ways of doing things, parachute landing in a cylinder tank. He noticed a lecture of some sort, the man was a tad older looking than Vice standing in front of roughly fifteen student Sages. Phaz came up to the crowd and sat down.</span>
<span>&quot;OY did you pay?&quot; The man shouted at Phaz.</span>
<span>&quot;Um no do I have to?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes you have to what do you think this is?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;My bad. How much?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Seventy five lucys&quot;</span>
<span>Thats a rip off. Phaz thought this is a con artist pushing the get rich quick scheme for base jumping. Plus he was certain the reason he broke his leg was because he was too close to the wall when letting out the parachute. </span>
<span>&quot;Seventy five? I don&#39;t know if I have that much.&quot;</span>
<span>The lecturer turned towards the class. &quot;I said this before and I will repeat it for your sake, not mine. The lessons you learn here will prove defining between you pancaked on the core, or fully formed inside it next to your sleeping self. Do you get me?&quot;</span>
<span>The class nodded in excitement and clapped egregiously. Phaz had thirty lucys at most, he grabbed the pair of deezyess hanging of his shoulder and slammed them in front. </span>
<span>&quot;These are worth at least one hundred.&quot;</span>
<span>The man nodded and pointed to go sit down. As Phaz was about to sit the man said, </span>
<span>&quot;As I was saying before, and we will do a demonstration soon with my colleague here, the goal is to be letting out when falling in the center back of the hole.&quot; As he continued. Phaz was half way to sitting down when he sprung back up and went back for his deezyess, grabbed them and left. This might be a different world, but people are still from Earth. He could not let go of his arrogant ways, do it myself type of attitude. He went back into the market to search for parachutes. He asked around but not many were interested in base jumping. He returned to the old woman.</span>
<span>&quot;Sorry to bother you again. Vice told me to tell you to sow another parachute for her.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Vice? She&#39;s back?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yes she is at the demonstration of parachute jumping assisting the instructor.&quot; Phaz was somewhat of a pathological lier, he got away with so many lies and cut corners because of it that he developed a nasty habit for it. But Phaz felt bad for tricking the old woman. He took out his thirty lucys that he had left.</span>
<span>&quot;She also told me to pass this on to you.&quot;</span>
<span>The woman took the lucys and went back to her machine. &quot;Come back in two hours it will be ready for pickup.&quot;</span>
<span>Phaz exited the tent, as he began walking toward the tavern he spotted a tall man rather old walking by. That was Kalgaard, he had Sages huddled around him following lead.</span>
<span>&quot;Listen kids. I do not have much time right now. I will be able to take question in a couple hours.&quot; Two foxes followed his suit as he disappeared behind the fortress of towers.</span>
<span>&quot;Hey whats the fuss about?&quot; Phaz grabbed onto the shoulder of one of the kids.</span>
<span>&quot;Descensus ad inferos. Descent of Sages soul to hell. It&#39;s said to happen soon&quot;</span>
<span>Phaz shook his head as if he misheard what the young Sage said. </span>
<span>&quot;Hold on can you repeat that?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Youre lucky to be here now, it occurs every millenial. If you spill your blood into the Core, your soul becomes possessed by Zanima or Zanimus.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;They are in constant pain. The pain is living hell, Why would anyone do that?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Hence the name. You inherit their pain, but also their powers.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Powers? They&#39;re carnivorous beasts.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You get to move like them. Remember, they come out of the core where our sleeping bodies lay, and then they appear eight hundred miles above in like two minutes.&quot;</span>
<span>The story clicked and Phazes face lit up.</span>
<span>&quot;Bear the pain of the demon, and in return you get a quick ride home.&quot;</span>
<span>&#39;Exactly.&#39; The Sages face blossomed in smiles. &quot;But the stories from the previous millennial are horrific. Its said the pain is so unbearable that they kill themselves before reaching the core.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Its like a three minute ride, you cant hold on for that long?&quot;</span>
<span>The Sage shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Thats how bad it is I guess.&quot;</span>
<span>Damn, thats the only thing Phaz could think of.</span>
<span>&quot;When does it start?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;We don&#39;t know, thats why we are waiting for the wise one to tell us.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;The old dude?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yeah, but don&#39;t call him that.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Shouldn&#39;t he know already.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;We roughly know that a millennial has passed. The wise one is figuring it out.&quot;</span>
<span>Phaz tapped on the Sages shoulder and nodded, &quot;Thank you, I&#39;ll catch you soon.&quot; and headed back to the tent. </span></p><hr /><p><span>&quot;You almost killed me!&quot; Jona was putting up a fit.</span>
<span>&quot;But I didn&#39;t.&quot; He was mad that Tenengas bullet came at a close proximity to his face.</span>
<span>&quot;You didn&#39;t even care..&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;re right, I could&#39;ve left you. Maybe we should have, Lex what do you think?&quot; Tenenga was enjoying the teasing on Jona. Jax enjoyed it even more since it took away the slack from him.</span>
<span>&quot;Leave me out of it.&quot; Lexia was back in her normal mood, daydreaming. She drew on her memory of father and mother holding hands when watching a movie. Lexia was hiding behind the couch. The movie was rated-R and she loved the thrill of watching something forbidden. Then her dog gave up her hidden spot and the parents found her. Both mom and dad took her do the room giggling along the way at the sight of Lexias sneaky actions. Her parents were madly in love, Lexia asked for them to stay till she fell asleep. And so they all fell asleep on her bed. Those are one of her most cherished memories Lexia reminisced upon. Seeing the shadows of her demonic parents walking down the alley in the underworld city right before they changed left a dwelling sensation. A sorrow longing for mom and dad. Then instantaneously the human like beast with falling muscles and no skin appeared in her conscious realm, she yanked back. The bullet wound was healing and Zola was walking again.</span>
<span>&quot;Is everything alright?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yeah, just, they keep appearing in my mind. Like a flash.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;The monsters?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;The same way like when I was in the hospital.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I mean they cant be as bad as the demons?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I don&#39;t know. They&#39;re scarier.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Really? How so?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;They just are.&quot; Lexia shutdown and returned back into her shell. </span>
<span>Zola thought about telling her what Kalgaard said. </span>
<span>&quot;Listen Lexia. Those monsters. Kalgaard says he knows of them. They aren&#39;t demons.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia was listening with her head down, she muttered quietly.</span>
<span>&quot;What are they?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I don&#39;t know. But it seems like that was a message.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia looked up at Zola clueless.</span>
<span>&quot;You might be summoned.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;That.. that doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Nothing makes sense Lex.&quot; Zola paused for a second. &quot; Look where we are. When I first arrived to ELucid, Kalgaard took us under because of Tenenga. She was speaking jibberish. Kalgaard decyphered it from old manuscripts of Valorettian, symbols from temples of JNGIX, the second city.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;What was it?&quot;</span>
<span>Zola tried to be as accurate in pronunciation as possible.</span>
<span>&quot;Coren alhi Zedex asu Zedasu voltrix sa zun, when Zanima and Zanimus become one.&quot;</span>
<span>Repeating it sent a chill through Zolas spine. &quot;Kalgaard thinks gods communicate with the levels below by possessing Sages, or demons for that matter. When Zanima and Zanimus merge into one, they transcend into gods. When you appeared, these monsters you were speaking off seemed different than demons. They could be what you saw that night at the hospital.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;But why me or?&quot; Lexia looked at Tenenga walking alongside Jona messing back and fourth gayly.</span>
<span>&quot;Or Ten? I dont know. You guys were the ones they decided to use. But you in particular, well I don&#39;t know, Lex you might not like this.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia looked at Zola suspiciously. </span>
<span>&quot;... its whatever already... What?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Kalgaard thinks you might not wake up back in your body on Earth.... You might go deeper in the unconscious. Where gods are. The monster you described are found on ancient manuscripts. Its both female and male, believed to be the stage turning genderless and becoming god like.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;No. Thats not true. The body was falling apart&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;When Zanima and Zanimus merge, the second stage begins and they are stripped of any matter. Only the spirit remains.&quot;</span>
<span>That would explain the falling muscles and skinless bodies Zola thought, and Lexia arrived to that conclusion right after.</span>
<span>&quot;They were crying in pain.&quot; Lexia remembers.</span>
<span>&quot;Just like the demons yes. The stripping of the material self must be really painful. And the demons here are also crying. For them its living hell.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Does that mean that happens to me too?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I think the Sage remains in human form, whereas all the other representations of the sleeping self change. I don&#39;t think you become them. But I really don&#39;t know at this point Lex.&quot;</span>
<span>Lexia fell back into her restless mood. She had something to ponder on now that it gave her some clarity on the images of those half gods, she guessed.</span>
<span>&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me before?&quot;</span>
<span>Zola was waiting for that specific question.</span>
<span>&quot;I wanted to but considering you haven&#39;t even fought your first demon yet, and you were mine then..&quot;</span>
<span>They both are aware that they&#39;ve grown older. Time is relative to motion, but since there is no day and night, just day, the only thing showing time is rate of change on their body. Lexia looked much older than when she arrived on ELucid. She also wasn&#39;t angry Zola for keeping.</span>
<span>&quot;I understand. Thanks... I guess.&quot; Her head tilted down again. </span></p><p><span>They reached the hole, the warmth from the core touched their faces. They crossed the hole over to the other side and opened the hatch. THe tunnel was extremely narrow and the sound of the hatch closing behind them stopped instantaneously. Unlike other tunnels, they had to duck while passing and the walls were closing in more on them every couple feet. Zola was wondering if they made the right move. After an hour of jogging they arrived at a dead end, the ceiling was destroyed with the path blocking their way to the next platform. Jona started digging, he mounted his last grenade at the bottom of the blockade and they all hid for cover. The explosion created a hole big enough to puncture through the rest of the blockade, and on the other side they found a semi automatic sliced in half and pieces of body armor. Part of the ceiling fell down again plugging the hole just made by the explosion. They slowly kept moving along the path in hopes of meeting someone or something. Can a blade slice through a gun like that? Zola guessed its possible, then Jax noticed a trail leading from the gun deeper into the tunnel. As if someone was crawling on the ground with their entire body, a wounded Sage perhaps. The trail lead them to the hatch where the platform lay. It was pitch dark inside and Zola lit up the place with her flame thrower, lighting the torches on fire. The body of the Sage they were expecting to see was there, in the middle of the room laying paralyzed. If he was dead, he would have disintegrated Zola thought. She yelled out for Tenenga to stop but it was to late.</span>
<span>&quot;He&#39;s breathing!&quot; The boy was completely paralyzed. His face was restless, his eyes were rapidly moving. </span>
<span>Tenenga grabbed his hand and squeezed hard.</span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;re okay, you&#39;re with us now.&quot; His eyes began to tear up. Lexia and Tenenga almost cried at the sight. Lexia looked at his eyes.</span>
<span>&quot;Blink twice for yes and once for no. Say yes.&quot; He blinked twice. </span>
<span>&quot;Did a Sage do this to you?&quot; The boy blinked once.</span>
<span>&quot;Demons?&quot; He blinked once again. The girls looked at each other then they turned to Zola. She was clueless as well, but his face was rather familiar. They looked at him again and he signaled down where his chest armor was. Tenenga lifted the armor and two snakes jumped out poking at her. They didn&#39;t bite her, the sage began moving violently suving them off and standing up. Zola recognized the boy from the car crash, the last glance at him before they lost consciousness on the road. </span>
<span>&quot;Get away from him!!&quot; Zola yelled. She pulled out her blade and the snakes hissing charged at her. So did the demonic Sage shadow. Those were Zolas Zanimus, the rest of the group formed into fighting position, expecting their own any second.</span>
<span>&quot;When did the core move?&quot; Jax was angry, he hates surprises, even if its a surprise party for his birthday, still hates it.</span>
<span>&quot;It didn&#39;t.&quot; Zola was confident she couldn&#39;t miss it.</span>
<span>The ground only shakes because of the crusty plates holding the walls and ceilings of the underworld structure. In this case the avalange blocked off the platform from the hole, acting as a filter and amortizing the shaking. Atleast that was Zolas best guess. She ducked as the warrior like demon charged at her with his sword. They both clashed tripping her to the ground, she dug her blade deep into his chest. Second Zanimus appeared flinging at her. By then both Tenenga and Jona were onto their count. Jax followed with Lexia still waiting. </span>
<span>&quot;Lex?&quot; A voice came from her right. It was her father, he was walking over calmly. She held her sword high in the air ready to strike. </span>
<span>A blue ivy halo showed itself glowing around his neck.</span>
<span>&quot;I missed you. Let me show you how I&#39;ve been.&quot; </span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;re not him!&quot; She swiped the sword across his chest. The blade slid through, leaving him unharmed. </span>
<span>&quot;Roll out your palm Lex. Let me show you.&quot; He was standing right in front of her. She tried pushing him away but her hands fell through.</span>
<span>&quot;What are you?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I&#39;m your father Lex, let me show you.&quot; He stepped forward disappearing inside her. A stung turned quickly to a piercing sensation inside her chest. She moved hazardously dropping the sword to the ground. She tried to resist, but her will was no more hers. She stood straight up, her fathers Zanimus possessing her, kneeled down to pick up the blade. He extended her left arm and widened her hand. He stuck the blade to her pinky and sliced it off. Lexia was yelling in agony but from the inside. No one could hear her, and the pain of the demon possessing her was much greater than cutting the finger off. The Zanimus pushed her away dropping Lexia to the ground as they split with the fathers shadow remaining above her. He grabbed the finger quickly and dropped into all fours, his shoulders widened and he formed into a beast like creature she was used to killing. The ivy blue halo changed to red. Into gallop the demon disappeared in the tunnel with her finger. None of her other demons appeared for the remainder of the time.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Phaz picked up the parachute and was waiting outside the gate by the fortress. The young Sages where all huddled around where Kalgaard was last seen but Phaz was unable to spot his new friend. The fortress gates opened and out came Kalgaard, next to him was the young Sage Phaz spoke too. Kalgaard signaled him to return to the Sages and off he disappeared behind the fortress. </span>
<span>&quot;Descensus ad inferos begins at the totality of the full eclipse.&quot;</span>
<span>The crowd went silent. The moon was already at its early stages of blocking the sun. A very rare occurrence on this world. The last time ELucid saw darkness was nine hundred years ago when paintings of the eclipse were resurrected from Kalgaards predecessor tombs.</span>
<span>&quot;When does it end?!&quot; One of the Sages yelled back.</span>
<span>Murmurs went up, the smallest of them all spoke. &quot;Who knows. LETS GO!&quot; The crowds cheered as they began running towards the hole. A bunch of young brats that have no clue what they are about to experience, just a fast ticket out. But what made Phaz any different from them, he pondered at the question as he followed behind. </span></p><p><span>Arriving at the hole was like arriving at a canyon sized creator, to which a bunch of little kids were about to pour their guts out to turn demon. The partial eclipse was coming to an end and the great shadow of the moon began casting itself on ELucid. Everyone stood aligned by the edge as they watched the Sun disappear behind the moon. Two smaller moons were orbiting not to far from the eclipse, it truly looked beautiful in sight Phaz thought. The diamond ring effect began taking shape with minimal light getting through. They slit their palms, wrists, legs, whatever they preferred. The problem was, a drop of blood was very unlikely to reach the Core. The small one figured it out first, he cut his finger off dropping it one thousand feet below. Automatically a bunch of Sages stepped back. Then the sun disappeared and timid darkness covered the entire visible terrain.</span>
<span>&quot;If you&#39;re not okay with the pain of loosing a finger, then how do you expect to deal with the unbearable pain of the demon.&quot; The smart young Sage that Phaz met spoke with great confidence. In pitch black Phaz stuck his arm out, and with one quick swoosh off it fell into the deep end. And so he waited. The sound of the smallest Sage falling to the ground crying alerted the rest that it already began. Phaz also dropped on his knees and grabbed on to his face in agony. The sensation of his skin burning, mutating into wider bone structure was a small percentage of whatever he was going to feel soon. The little Sage dug his paws into the stairs and began running violently like a loose wolf. As the Sages listened frightened, he jumped on to wall crushing the stone. With his claws and teeth he chewed out the remainder of the wall and disappeared into the dirt like a mole in the graveyard. Everyone fell silent, then a couple of them on the ground started crying in similar fashion. By that moment Phaz was shrieking meddling in the dirt. A gory sensation in his chest appeared and it spread like wildfire across into the four limbs. As if someone poured gasoline over him and lit a match. His neck snapped and jolted forward, his spine structure widened creating space for him to move freely on all fours. The Sages upfront possessed turned savage and immediately began biting into each other. Others jumped off into the hole they just couldn&#39;t take it. Problem was the possessed Sages weren&#39;t thinking straight and didn&#39;t realize they would be falling for hours before they hit the core and died. An immense amount of adrenaline mixed with acute pulsating pain in the nervous system pushed him into a gallop. He lost complete control of himself and smashed into one of the others tearing them apart. He jumped on the wall shrieking and digging his claws into the dirt. The pain was intensifying and it made him dig harder, clawing through dirt with no recollection of what he was, biting through it like a savage beast. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Tom Hunter untied Vice from Zolas knot when the following core shifted. She got lucky or else her demons would&#39;ve eaten her alive. They fought of their Zanimus and Zanima with tactical advantage in the underworld city. When the demon count finished they lay resting for a couple minutes.</span>
<span>&quot;They went down the deep tunnel.&quot; </span>
<span>&quot;Yeah give me a minute will ya.&quot; Hunter exhaled as he lay on the rooftop edge. Then sounds of shrieking and eruptions roaring appeared from above where the platform with the punctured hole hang. Bits of the ceiling dripped above her. Vice supported herself on the elbows looking up.</span>
<span>&quot;What th...?&quot; The noise grew louder as the ceiling rumbled. Savage creatures burst out of the ceiling falling hundred of feet below smashing into the near buildings. The gory noise only intensified. Possessed Sages were tearing anything in their way and digging deeper. Then another creature smashed through the ceiling sending chunks of stone directly below Vice and Hunter. Vice rolled away to the middle of the roof and Hunter fell of the building. The rocks smashed into the corner of the rooftop crashing the ceiling and sending Vice down with it. A cloud of dust accumulated around Vice who wasn&#39;t seriously injured except for immense pain in her back. She lifted herself to see the dust blocking her view, the air began to clear and she noticed the possessed creature half Sage half demonic laying squashed next to her. </span>
<span>Vice wanted to yell but alkali dust was congesting her breathing tubes, and she began coughing violently. She began kicking away from the beast bolting into running position. Phaz has completely lost control of his body, he threw the rocks off and his demonic possession threw him violently towards Vice. She climbed up the steep tower in matter of seconds to find the demon right below her. Lowered her gun vertically down and shot wounding Phazes shoulder. He shrieked in fear like a puppy and backed off from the tower. Unlike other demons this one was different she thought and hid behind the tower columns away from the beasts sight. Possessed Phaz soon lost interest and began digging right below him. Vice watched closely like a hidden sniper watching her target. The beast was half Sage she thought, but it wasn&#39;t her demon and yet it almost killed her. Possessed he dug deep enough through the stone to hit the dirt and tore through disappearing in seconds. On the other side, Hunter was untouched watching in astonishment the last of the savage beasts digging deep through the stone and disappearing in matter of seconds. </span>
<span>&quot;Yo you good?&quot; Hunter caught eye of Vice as the last of the demons disappeared. </span>
<span>&quot;Those were demons.&quot; Vice and Hunter began their descent into the exiting tunnel of the underworld city.</span>
<span>&quot;They looked pretty familiar. Like demons V..&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Sages, from ELucid. They were trapped in the demon body.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Sages? Thats not possible.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Remember when they brought over that painting to the shop to trade for the semi automatics?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Yeah you told them to stick it up their you know what.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Whatever, when I was running errands for Gaartrich, I spotted the painting laying in the office. Well not his office, Kalgaards.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Where are you going with this?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;So I asked him, whats with the painting. He called it neuter plural, hell.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;It didn&#39;t seem that deep. Demons possessed and nothing we haven&#39;t seen.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Possessed, exactly. But those weren&#39;t the Sages demons. That was a human possessed in the body of the demon. You could see it in the paint.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;So you are saying those are Sages from ELucid that turned demon.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Self explanatory isn&#39;t it?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Why would they do that?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;To get to the core quickly.&quot;</span>
<span>That clicked and Hunter realized what she was implying, they did it voluntarily. Vice continued. &quot;So they found a way to turn Demon, but how?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Potion? Doesn&#39;t Kalgaard mix up dirt and leafs and things. He is a big old wise man with a long beard and a wizard hat!&quot; Hunter was sarcastically mocking his appearance, and Kalgaard didn&#39;t have a hat. Vice ignored the comment, she was to focused on reasoning with the facts.</span>
<span>&quot;The source of demons derives from the core. Whatever he used must have come from down below.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I didn&#39;t see any jobs posted for that. And anyway we are probably the only ones on Elucid that would go to the core to retrieve anything he&#39;d need.&quot; Hunter raised his left eyebrow. &quot;As long as the chi ching is good of course.&quot;  He rubbed his fingers together.</span>
<span>&quot;I guess so. Unless his brother did it. He was gone for quite sometime.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Gaartrich? Wouldn&#39;t you know?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Ulbrichx, the third keeper. He&#39;s in Jngix city. His kind carry out experiments there, its pretty much the lab for their academia.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;It must suck being born here, living and dying. And the harsh conditions, sometimes I really think how lucky we are to be born on Earth.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;You&#39;re not going to flake out on me right?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Does it look like I am? And anyway, why do you care?&quot;</span>
<span>Vice just shrugged her shoulders.</span>
<span>&quot;I don&#39;t know just do. Besides the thing tried to kill not long ago.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Its not like you care.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;I know.&quot; Vice was almost done polishing her multi-automatic rifle.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Tenenga was blasting rounds at her last Zanimus. She fell back tripping on a step and dropped her left gun. Lexia kicked it back to her as she finished the kill. The others still had many to kill, and the two girls observed as her sister torched three shadows of their father. A minute later Tenenga turned to Lexia who disappeared, except for a sound of a growling thing. She was looking directly above Lexia, who was scattered on all fours with saliva drooling onto Tenengas shoes. She backed off pointing straight at Lexia who was trying to resist the demonic possession. She yelled Lexias name but by that point the beast formed fully. With no volition the beast sniffed out Tenengas position and jumped knocking her down. They both wrestled on the ground as Lexia jabbed her newly formed claws into Tenenga rib cage. She yelled in pain kicking her off.</span>
<span>&quot;I DON&quot;T WANT TO SHOOT YOU LEX!!&quot; No response from Lexia. They both rolled over falling down the steps into the second level of the platform. Tenenga managed to push her off kicking the beast in the jaw. Possessed Lexia yelled out in madness as Tenenga unleashed a metallic breeze cutting into skin, just enough for Lexia to back away in fear.</span></p><p><span>Inside the body of Lexia, all her bone structures mutated into wider savage like form. The pain was excruciating in her limbs, feeling of skin pealing off, burning all over in adjudicating manner. She started digging into the ground tearing the rocks into pieces. Tenenga observed as her friend disappeared below leaving her shotgun and blade behind. </span></p><p><span>Possessed, Lexia dug her claws into the dirt chunking large portions behind and in between her legs. Her sight adjusted to the scouring eyes of the demon. Only five minutes passed and she pierced through the last layer flying straight at the core. The gravity is flipped from inside the globe, and her entire perspective changed. The inversed gravitational pull whiplashed her sending her back to the hole that she just dug out of. The core was so bright it blinded her bursting a roar into a broken shriek of gory pain and living hell. With the core floating directly above her rotating slowly like a giant sphere of melted spirits, her bones began decaying back into her formal body. The beat of the core drum rolled breaking noises collapsing and superseding one another. She yelled out the last of her breath as the claws sunk back into her tiny hands. There were others next to her. Phaz, he lay there breathing heavy as his fingers returned to normal flinching back and fourth. Lexia felt the rushing sensation of muscle movement returning to her. The pain lingered but not for long. Drenched in aching joint pain she lifted herself with the last of minuscule tissues returning to her normal skin. The sight of the core shifting was mesmerizing in its entirety shining in ivy blue timid color washed in titanium white glow with little to show for its blood red center. Her mouth closed when she heard Phaz and the others lift themselves up. All were staring directly above when Lexia recollected Phazes face and the previous encounter, she reached for her gun but it wasn&#39;t there, her blade was gone too. Phaz froze realizing the same, he raised his arms in surrender indicating his peace with her. She wasn&#39;t interested in him, instead very confused. The Sages scattered around looking at patterns of equal geometry carved with persistent elegance around the ground of the dome. There were three massive holes above, the one next to them lead to Elucid, the second to Jngix and third to Ay Byatos, the dead city. Phaz was fascinated by the fact that the temperature was rather cool. Then the core shifted and the hour of demonic battle in the underworld came to an end. The blue ivy surrounding the center of the core changed and out poured the red. Truly a breathless panoramic view Phaz thought as the flash of the shift  generated its own electro magnetic field around the levitating sphere and began expanding in all directions. The patterned carvings around and underneath the Sages birthed a stream of blue ivy glow just as the last of it was seen leaving the core, and the glow spread like wildfire throughout the dome. As the field expanded the Sages backed away in fear of being swallowed. Lexia stopped, she heard a thought in her mind that was unlike anything she ever felt before. Smooth with a gentle touch at the end it asked her to stop resisting. Good awaits you on the other side, others heard it too. One Sage didn&#39;t buy it and ran back jumping into the hole, once he crossed the line the reverse gravity worked its magic and spat him back onto the floor of the dome. Lexia stepped forward touching the first layer of the silky field as it drew its curtains onto her entire body. She disappeared leaving no trace and scared sages alone, Phaz stepped in next.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Lexias sense of the ground disappeared beneath her. Nature vibrates but at this instant the sense of any presence vanquished. Golden silence triumphed as sensation of time fragmented underneath a still sense of motionless being. A soft touch of timid air like fur covered her entire self in warmth. Nothing, metallic white space all around with the sphere already contracted into a little spec of light. She looked down at her arms, there was nothing there but disintegrated space. The feeling of her body remained, like phantom pain she felt her limbs floating alongside still attached, but nowhere to be seen. The overwhelming sensation of purity was implicit in the fact that she wasn&#39;t thinking. Just observing, a totality of awareness beyond the senses. Before she could realize that vocal cords were gone, that she couldn&#39;t even speak, that there were no tools for it, a gentle thought appeared in the stream of her consistent presence. </span></p><p><em><span>Hello.</span></em><span> It felt alien, not of her personality.</span></p><p><em><span>Who is this?</span></em><span> The question was Lexias rather impulsive response. There was someone else in her mind.</span></p><p><span>A sensation on her face mounted, she felt her eyes blink slowly infront, not of her possessed soul but also not of her own  will.  </span></p><p><span>Another sharper voice translated through her mind.  </span></p><p><em><span>Where am I?</span></em></p><p><span>The voice continued questioning. Separated from it by feeling and thought, she imagined the white space she was in, trying to comprehend it and imagine it.</span></p><p><em><span>Here?</span></em><span> She thought.</span></p><p><span>The voice responded confused. </span><em><span>Where here? Who is this?</span></em></p><p><span>Lexia looked down again, nothing. Then she remembered, </span></p><p><em><span>Lexia. My name is Lexia.</span></em><span> The name felt separate, a strangers name to the witness she felt to be at the moment. </span></p><p><em><span>Lexia? Wait.  I&#39;m Phaz.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Phaz? Jacob, my name is Jacob.</span></em><span> A third voice? They all felt apart of her mind. Confused, was she imagining them?</span></p><p><em><span>Wait who is this? No.. I&#39;m Victoria!</span></em></p><p><em><span>That&#39;s not my name!</span></em></p><p><em><span>Pavel, my name is Pavel.</span></em></p><p><span>A swarm of voices stormed her realm spouting their own identities trying to recognize themselves inside whatever it is that they were all apart of. Overcrowded without her ability to hear herself Lexia panicked, or so she thought she did because she felt like yelling but then at the very last second the feeling died. Drifting in front of the spec of light, she listened as stranger thoughts crowded her stream of consciousness. </span></p><p><em><span>Wait.</span></em><span> Calmly through volition she thought it. The voices died out and the total awareness of any outside stimuli mixed with complete silence inside her mind soaked in.</span></p><p><em><span>How many of us are here?</span></em><span> She continued. </span></p><p><em><span>Me</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><em><span>Me</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><em><span>I&#39;m here.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Me</span></em><span> In sync with another voice that sounded female and younger.</span></p><p><em><span>Me</span></em><span>. Then silence initiated a stop in the countdown. A moment passed again which indicated the last voice. Then Lexia broke the count.</span></p><p><em><span>Seven voices including me.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Are you from Elucid?</span></em><span> </span></p><p><span>One of them spoke back. And before Lexia could answer a river of unorganized chaotic thoughts broke out in their stream. Pushed to the back, Lexia tried to make sense of what was happening to her. The total absence of awareness of external stimuli vanished when heat  in her front top emerged and within seconds she was swallowed by the spec of light that birthed where the core previously collapsed. Voices intensified as the darkness overcame the white glow and the gory pain cut through every inch of her body till it disappeared, and with it so did the voices and Lexia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Jax and Jona were leading the pact. Tenenga grew paranoid of her friends disappearance and remained quiet. They were nearing the last  platform only a hundred miles away from the core. All drained out from multiples battles, only Jona and Zola needed some extra time to heal, their bruises were visible through the armor.  Ten miles from the hole their tunnel widened.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I didn&#39;t think this part would be so big.&quot; Jax tried to spark a conversation with Zola to brighten the mood.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yeah. Its not on the map.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let me see.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Zola handed him the paper. The tunnel was as big as the last platform they were at, barely a tunnel Jax thought. Then a door with a hatch appeared at the end, very small in comparison with the wall that proceeded above it.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Damn.&quot; Jonas jaw dropped.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yeah you&#39;re right about that size as a water dam.&quot; Jax responded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;No I meant....&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Guys, this feel sketchy.&quot; Tenengas alert meter was up and running. For the last two hundred miles it was down, so this alerted Zola as well. As they neared the core they heard moaning voices from inside. They got into position and cocked back their shotguns. Jax opened the hatch to find complete darkness. Zola pulled out her flame thrower but this time only shooting out an immense pressurized stream of flammable liquor far ahead, then changing the setting she lit it on fire creating a dragon trail lighting the room. More like a a giant military bunker it spread across hundreds of feet like the lost underworld city. Zola stepped in followed by Jax and the rest. What she saw was unimaginable at the time, the side walls contained sophisticated tanks with Sages floating in them half conscious. Tenenga waived at them and their eyes had minimum response, a light blink. Thousands of Sages sedated, not enough to loose consciousness and for the soul to leave this world, and just enough to keep them alive, preventing the body from reappearing on the surface of Elucid. </span></p><p><span>&quot;How long have they been here...?&quot; Jona whispered. </span></p><p><span>&quot;How are they..&quot; </span></p><p><span>&quot;They&#39;re paralyzed top to bottom.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Tenenga couldn&#39;t look anymore. She smashed the tank letting a Sage out. </span></p><p><span>&quot;TEN!&quot; Zola shouted, the echo spread fast and like bats the protectors of this demonical garden fell down from the ceiling. They backed away towards the hatch as Tenenga grabbed onto the Sage and dragged him back. The demon charged at Tenenga as before reaching her it froze and its reptilic shape conversed into a synapsid like demon with scales and scutes. </span></p><p><span>&quot;Unfortunately that does not belong to you. Why dont you put the body down?&quot; The demons voice was neither female or male.  A creepy shadow lurking over it drew calmly toward Tenenga. Zola fired two shots hitting the demon, it flailed like wildfire the returning back to its human form. Jax grabbed onto the body and as he helped her push the Sage through the door, back into the tunnel where they came from, the sage regained full vision. The demon roared enraged stumbling upon another gunshot  from Zola. Before reaching the group Jona closed the door locking the hatch in extreme anxiety. </span></p><p><span>&quot;What the hell was that?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Vampires?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No not in this world.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then what the hell was it?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Demons.&quot; Drained in gel the sage spoke. He tried pushing himself on the ground but his bones were weak, he hasn&#39;t felt the pull of gravity in ages Tenenga thought. She helped him up as he tried to maintain balance. His knees kept on folding sending him back onto Tenengas and Jonas shoulders. </span>
<span>&quot;Do you know your name?&quot;</span></p><p><span>The Sage tried hard lifting his head up, his neck was very weak. &quot;Ramon.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ramon, do you know how long you&#39;ve been here?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No....Long time... Thank you.&quot; Ramon began tearing up. They let a breeze of silence through as the sounding of the hushing voices flew in draught behind the door.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You need to learn to walk again. We don&#39;t have much time.&quot; Zola spotted a hole underneath the wall on the right side of the tunnel. Like a hidden rat hole, it seemed the floor was lower sometime in the past and someone or something has built a new layer on top.  Jax followed, &quot;Blow a couple rounds, see if it opens.&quot; Zola suggested. His semi automatic blasted sending a long echo through the channel, then the voices behind the door exploded in chaos.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are those things? You said Demons?&quot;</span></p><p><span>Ramon was working heavy on his muscle movement. &quot;Yeah, the elder kind.&quot; </span></p><p><span>Jax and Zola paused.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Before Zanima and Zanimus?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Even older. When Demons were genderless.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Before mammalian times on earth?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Really? You telling me that reptiles and those goblin looking fish birds had demons?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I guess, Its evolutionarily. Their savage like behavior is still seen in our demons.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why though? Its like 300million years old.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;On earth. Here, close to a billion. The underworlds are much more  developed. They know what they are doing. These reptilic demons retreated after their Drahen and Dragez successors defeated the underworld city, the Gaards. They took the remainder of the broken crystals from the cathedral and over many millennial used it to harvest...... us.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What about male and female demons?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;They belong to the core. Technically speaking, they probably don&#39;t even know that their ancestors exist.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ewww. Another form of being here. Its disgusting.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;At least on this world, the core is a two way gate to upper and also lower realms, forever infinite. A human body in a coma has its soul connected to this realm through the core. The demons are parts of yourself that stay in the unconscious of the human world, and are conscious in this world. The Sage like form of you here now, is an unconscious form of you on Earth.&quot; Ramon regained his breath as he continued the story almost everyone heard before, he spoke with deep passion. &quot;If you leave the human world, you land here. There is no coincidence. Siriso is the realm below the Earths. And you don&#39;t want to know what is below this one.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hell?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No, it doesn&#39;t exist. Siriso is as close as it gets to it. But as you can see you are well equipped tonight them. Till these little lizards come along....The lower realms are much older, sophisticated and they govern much of your intuition here and on earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wait so what are we? Why am I here and in the other realms as well.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You&#39;re forever infinite. That means your soul is distributed among infinite realms. You are just a tiny fraction.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Depressing...Whats the point.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Here? Kill demons.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;On earth?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well thats heaven in my opinion. To reproduce the gene...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There more to life then just that!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is there?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Thats depressing too.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The purpose does not matter. It does not change the fact that you have unconsciously decided to carry out an action before you are consciously aware of it. Whichever realm you are on, you still are just an observer.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Technically speaking.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well what other way is there to speak?&quot;</span></p><p><span>Tenenga shrugged her shoulders. He had a point.</span></p><p><span>Then Zola realized what Kalgaard was trying to say about Lexia.</span></p><p><span> &quot;Can a lower being from the realm below this one, summon someone from the realm above on Earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Not that I know off. You need to first open the door to the house before you can open the door to your room.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Jonas diy made gun powder  bomb exploded creating a large enough hole to see where the adjacent berried tunnel led to. Unfortunately for Jax it wasn&#39;t exactly a tunnel but an ancient slide n die run. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Lexia opened her eyes as darkness flooded her eye lids with fluid texture. Bubbles appeared going sideways, </span><em><span>WATER!</span></em><span> </span></p><p><span>Lexia paddled violently  toward the direction of the bubbles. Bright light appeared the size of the core when it collapsed. Others were floating around it still paralyzed. Lexia swam toward Phaz to wake him up, in a state of panic he settled to his state of reality and woke the rest. Lexia was above the floating core, she extended her hand to touch it. The shrunk down core let out a light frequency that dispersed throughout the deep waters. The Sages turned around as they stared at the sphere of the inner core just like the one on Elucid, except this time it was all underwater. The three giant crater sized holes appeared at the end of the spheres, not knowing which one led to Elucid, Phaz signaled for the upper one. Lexia touched the core again sending another shock beam of light across the sphere and into the holes. As they reached the crater hole they made a leap crossing the line between the sphere and the hole.  Their speed changed instantaneously as their bodies acted as inflated balloon trying to rediscover the surface again. Lexia was running out of breath but it was still pitch dark and no sign of light from above. She could only see as far as Phaz who was directly above her.  Lexia panicked as she saw what she feared to be a great white shark. Seconds before a panic attack the body appeared to be a white scuba diver followed by two more. They grabbed onto Phaz, Lexia and the two sages below them and gave them oxygen  tanks to breathe. One of the divers took out an extra tank, and blew air into a huge balloon. Their speed dramatically shot up taking them up to the surface in less than five minutes. They came out gasping for air when Lexia realized there were four of them. </span></p><p><span>&quot;Where are the other two?&quot;</span></p><p><span>The divers unzipped looking dumbfounded,</span></p><p><span>&quot;Other two? Its just you guys.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No we had seven in total, its five of us here.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The radar only picked up five signals. No point in going back now, I assume they didn&#39;t have oxygen as well.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The divers looked about the same size and age as all the other Sages of Elucid. </span></p><p><span>Phaz looked at Lexia in disappointment. &quot;There is nothing we can do...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Where are we?&quot; </span></p><p><span>&quot;Gimsta. The city of families. You are not allowed to be here. You will be transported to Hice soon.&quot;</span></p><p><em><span>Living... The second city.</span></em><span> Phaz looked up at the diver, &quot;What is the third city?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Mors. Its where you might end up if Hiceitians rule not in your favor... Lets go.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The five Sages were shuved into the truck as the divers unloaded their cargo. One of them jumped into the back of the truck and shut the door as the truck drove.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What were you doing in our core? how did you get there undetected?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We don&#39;t know. We are from Elucid.&quot; That was one of the girls that was with Phaz and Lexia.</span></p><p><span>The diver still in full body suit with water dripping below him looked surprised. He straightened his back, &quot;Elucid? Like the fairy tale?&quot; He chuckled.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes. Its very similar to this world. Except the core is a clock and the underground is dry, no water and we have to fight demons.&quot; She was dead serious and freezing.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Schyzo...&quot; The diver looked away from her in disbeleif and turned toward Phaz. &quot;You mind telling me whats going on?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;She&#39;s not lying. We are from Elucid. We reached the core and we were supposed to appear back on Earth, our original home. But then we woke up here.&quot;</span>
<span>The diver took out what looked like a microphone, &quot;No luck here so far.&quot; As he slid it back into his suit pocket, he turned to Lexia. &quot;You look familiar. You work for Maya?&quot; </span></p><p><span>Lexia perplexed stayed silent. </span></p><p><span>&quot;No? Maya, the crazy nutso who is trying to overthrow Hice?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I wouldn&#39;t know. I&#39;m not from here.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Just a bunch of schyzos.&quot; The diver then put away the mic again as the truck went to a hault. The doors opened and the five Sages found themselves on an military looking airport base. Handcuffed, all were led to the back of the plane where their hands were locked in with their feet and chained to the side railings of the corpus that made up the inner sides of the cargo plane. </span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#39;m special forces sergeant Wokannabe, I&#39;ll be leading your arrest till we get to Hice. In the meantime sit comfortably strapped to the side walls as Doctor Matilda comes to examine you.&quot; Wokannabe left the back passing by the doctor. The doctor came up assessing the Sages eye sights, mouths, noses and gathering all testable evidence to use before trial. </span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you remember your name?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ofcourse. Lexia.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Age?&quot;</span></p><p><span>Lexia didnt know what to say.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Its complicated.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You don&#39;t know your age?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I do but, You must realize something. We are not from this world.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Where are you from?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Earth. Originally...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then how old are you there?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ten.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ten years old?&quot;</span></p><p><span>The doctor turned to Phaz. His face exemplified a bored stillness.</span></p><p><span>&quot;My name is Phaz. From earth. Sixteen years old.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The doctor wrote down what looked like only one word in her notes. She turned to the next.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Victoria, fourteen and from Earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Pavel, fifteen and from Earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Jacob, sixteen, Earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Phaz turned to Lexia amazed. &quot;You&#39;re ten?!&quot; In a hushing low voice.</span></p><p><span>A man walked in with a grey beard and a military uniform. He was well equipped with officer rankings newly polished. He discharged the doctor as she gathered the last of the samples and names and went into the front of the plane. He did not look like sergeant Wokannabe, instead, older and much wiser. The Sages hushed. </span></p><p><span>&quot;Hello kids. You will be transported soon to the local Hice base. After we get your results we will take you to your cell where you will spend the night before your trial tomorrow. You committed a hanous felony and the council wants to know why. More importantly, I want to know, how did you do it.&quot; The general stooped down to their eye level. </span></p><p><span>&quot;You know Maya has tried many tactics, but I never could imagine she could slip something up like this. How did you imagine? Steal the core and harvest it for some kind of bio weapon? Impossible. You must be schyzo like they say...&quot; He growled as he stood up, his slow painfully deep breath released a toxic smell of abnormal taste and smell. They almost threw up. </span></p><p><span>&quot;The core is how we got here. What do you use it anyway for?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The core is our means of life. It keeps the water flowing and recycling in the holes and keeps out ground moist. Without it this would be no mans land. You endangered the entire planet with your stunt. And somehow you managed to survive. Ridiculous.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We didn&#39;t try to steal it. The core is the gateway between realms.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Eh?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Realms. Earth is where we are from. We then arrived on Elucid city, an underworld where&quot; </span></p><p><span>Lexia stopped him right there. </span><em><span>Don&#39;t talk about the demons...</span></em><span> her face clearly stated that. Phaz got it.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We traveled between two realms now, this is our third world. The soul is eternal, we switched bodies from Earth to Elucid. For some reason, we still have the same bodies from Elucid.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What on earth do you think this is? This is earth nitwit.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Phaz was irritated. &quot;Who is Maya?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The opposition. They believe in looney tunes and abrakadabras coming out your ass, I bet you will fit right in.&quot; The general stood up, fixed up his suit transitioning to a perfect ninety degree swerve he returned back into the front part of the plane.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Jacob, right? What did Kalgaard say when he explained the soul. Its travels when falling asleep. What about death?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well thats eternal. I doubt you appear somewhere, I doubt you exist at that point. Why?&quot; Jacob answered rather curiously. </span></p><p><span>&quot;What if we just jump. Hope for the best?&quot; Phaz signaled at the trigger that Wokannabe used to close the trunk of the airplane. Jacob nodded in denial.</span></p><p><span>&quot;No way dude I rather hold the trial.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Diverge the guards.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What no dude just chill you&#39;ll get us killed.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hold on.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Phaz began spazzing out while tied to the walls of the cargo lounge. One of the two guards yelled, &quot;Whats happening to him.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Go check it out.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The guard came up close to Phaz who was violently pulsating back and fourth like a panic attack enthusiast. As the guard reached to push Phaz back to the wall, with both of his legs locked he kicked the guard down and reached for his gun. Phaz caught him by surprise and the guard wasn&#39;t able to react in time before Phaz took him out. The second guard pointed his semi automatic rifle straight at Phaz, &quot;DROP THE GUN KID. OR I&quot;LL SHOOT. Phaz reloaded and pointed it straight at him, the guard wasn&#39;t kidding as he released two shots hitting Phaz in the chest. Phaz backfired missing the guard, it turns out he wasn&#39;t aiming at the him but at the red button behind him. The planes back hatch opened and intense pressure sucked the guard out into thin dark night leaving the cargo empty. Phazes adrenaline kicked in and stomped on the guard beneath his feet keeping him from flying off. They must&#39;ve been flying really fast because the Sages could not hear a damn thing. &quot;GET HIS KEYS!!&quot; </span></p><p><span>Jacob understood what he was saying as she tried reaching for the guards pockets but the chains shackled him inches away from the dangling keys. Phaz released tension of the guard and he went flying toward Jacob. He caught him unraveling a set of keys for the handcuffs. The body flew out as Phaz began feeling immense pressure on his chest, his wound began bleeding heavy. He aimed for the trigger again closing the trunk. Jacob unlocked his four handcuffs and started unshackling the others.</span></p><p><span>Wokannabe appeared on the frontal staircase coming into the cargo section. Gun shots broke out as Phaz struggled to cover the others as they ducked. The plane began descending into the airbase and Wokannabe was instantaneously assisted by the general.</span>
<span>&quot;They broke out! How far are we from landing.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Two minutes. Keep them locked in, they are not getting out.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Four of them were hidden behind cargo as Jacob searched for parachutes.</span></p><p><span>The general drew fire hitting the front cargo.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Those are loaded with c4&#39;s!&quot; Wokannabe hissed. </span></p><p><span>&quot;Where are the parachutes?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;By the crane on the right.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Jacob untangled three parachutes from the wall, he swang them sliding two over. The generals shot pierced through Jacobs neck sending him to the ground cold. Victoria cried out as she caught the two parachutes. Phaz looked over with no hope of Jacob recovering he did what had to be done. He put on the parachute, &quot;Who has jumped before.&quot; </span>
<span>&quot;Me.&quot; Victoria put on the second parachute and grabbed Lexia. Phaz nodded as he grabbed Pavel. Phaz smashed the hatch button just as the planes wheels touched the ground. The sudden jolt threw the Sages off balance and the intense wind from the trunk opened caught the four whiplashing them out the back of the moving plane and onto concrete. They tumbled through the ground scraping much of their skin off. Within a minute the military police showed up shuving them into the back of the van. With burn marks all over Lexia looked over at Phaz. </span><em><span>It wasn&#39;t worth it.</span></em><span> Whats worse, Jacob was no longer there.</span></p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Depressed Phaz slid his fingers onto the scanner. The Sages were locked up for eight hours now with the word getting out that the core was breached. The cell gates opened and each Sage was let out individually and transported to the hearing court. The trial was held privately among the military police and council members and  the judge. </span></p><p><span>&quot;Phaz, is it?&quot; Seated infront of the judge and two men with suits nodded. &quot;We are told you are from Earth. But before you came here, you were on Elucid? Am I correct?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;And what is Elucid?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The world of demons.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The cops smiled in the face of absurdity. &quot;Demons? How did they look.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;They vary. Could be a monster. Your mother. Your father...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;And what did you do there?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We killed them.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;And why is that?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;To get to the core and remerge with our sleeping bodies on Earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The cops rested with their backs on the chairs.</span></p><p><span>&quot;And what prompted you to visit the world of demons?&quot;  Mockingly the cop pressured forward.</span></p><p><span>Phaz didnt answer as he sensed the tone.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>&quot;When in deep unconscious state my soul traveled to Elucid building a bridge between that world and earths.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;And the core is that gate way to your unconscious earthling.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span>One of the cops chuckled. The other one stroke his innocent looking beard as he continued.</span></p><p><span>&quot;So there is a core just like ours, but on Elucid?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Except its hollow. No water. Quite an empty sphere. The demon generator... so to speak.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The demons. What are they exactly?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Zanima and Zanimus. &quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;A female and a male projections of our loved ones, or, at least the worse fear we can imagine projected upon them. They come out of the core when it shifts every twelve hours.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The core is a clock?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The chuckling train of a vibe vanished in the room. Scientists have been studying the core on their world for decades. No one can make of the phenomena, the core shifts every twelve hours heating up the planet. Then it dies and the water becomes freezing cold. If you are in the water at the peak of the day the core will boil you, at the height of the night you will freeze to death in seconds.</span>
<span>&quot;Zanima and Zanimus. They can manifest themselves into your mother or father?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Sisters?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes. Wife or daughter, the whole lineage.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What if you don&#39;t have one?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#39;t matter. They&#39;re only projections. Your imagination feeds the rest.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then what makes it personal?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We don&#39;t know. All we do know is, that world serves a higher purpose specifically for the eternal being.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Eternal what?&quot; The cops put their shoulders on the table. The judge hasn&#39;t said a thing yet. He did not know what to make of it yet.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The self, me, you, we exist in higher forms. All throughout the universe. It is not a separate dimension. The being is an essential fragment for life. Here you are human right? Before there were humans, there was matter. For the sake of the argument.&quot; Thats when Phaz pulled himself up on the chair.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Matter is eternal. Forget atoms and your physics. By the way you have that here right?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Sure.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;When matter developed into complex systems like organisms, its cycle of life became much shorter. When the body dies in this dimension. The soul lives on because the self lives on in other dimensions. If the number of different realities is infinite, your soul is infinite, you are infinite and you never die. That is why your actions in this dimension feed the soul objective knowledge about the self, an upcycle that shapes the other dimensions yous, and a collective of all selfs forms the one soul for that specific being, called the eternal being.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yeah I mean that&#39;s just the multiple universes theory badly explained?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Right. But that&#39;s not the case. There are no alternate dimensions.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;So whats the point of the story?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There is no point. Instead of alternate universes, its just one universe. We are all a collective soul. What differentiates us are illusions. Eternal being is the constant programming of the collective unconscious to further support the consciousness which increases efficiency of programming the collective unconscious by living a conscious life. A never ending eternal cycle.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Okay so again, whats the point?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We operate in the subconscious. Our conscious individual actions feed the already evolved unconscious brain. By existing we build on top of the collective unconscious of nature, not just human nature. Nature distributes the collective unconscious among many beings, and those with more powerful unconscious objects are able to sustain what we call the complex conscious subject. We think we are individuals, but what we identify as is an illusion of the self, a self deception for the sake of individual survival. Because what we know about ourselves is only a fraction of the total true nature of the self. If you know only two percent lets say, for the sake of the argument, who you really are, then you know bollocks! But your unconscious self makes up most of you, and decides your intent before you can even make the conscious decision of the intention.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The judge looked at the cops. &quot;I believe he is sixteen like he claims. Did we dug up this kid to get a psych 101 pep talk?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let me finish.&quot; Phaz stroke his sides of the mouth to clean off the dried up saliva. &quot;Death is eternal. It allows for continuity of collective unconscious life. The soul is eternal. It allows for existence of conscious life. Who knows where you travel when you dream. Being aware while dreaming, who is to say that is not as real as your experience when awake?&quot;</span></p><p><span>The judge stood up, &quot;Get him the doctors he needs. We can&#39;t continue this trial.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#39;m crerating a story mixed with narratives when im awake and asleepp!&quot; Phaz stomped his hands on the table.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Definite psychosis!&quot; The judge yelled. Old man, not much soul.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Your honor, hear me out. I arrived at Elucid because I ended up in an accident and fell into a coma. My unconscious mind is dreaming right now as we speak. For all I know the concious part of me is here. But how is it that I remember everything from my life back on earth. The experiences I have from Elucid are more real then your mustache, pardon me. But when I wake up on earth in my old sixteen year old body, I will not remember a single thing unless that conscious part of me will be aware for the alst fifteen seconds of the dream. Then I might recount a thing or two.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The cop looked at the judge with mere uncertainty on his face.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You still haven&#39;t told us how you got to the core?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The re-emerging was supposed to send me back to Earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;And why didn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#39;t know! It sent me here. Its what I am trying to figure out. Am I deeper in the dream. I don&#39;t even know if I am in a dream.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dreams could be limitless. Maybe, its what I&#39;ve been asking myself all this time as well. But again, it does not answer the question. How did you get to the core passing the security system? Its dead locked beneath the surface.&quot; The cop was rather compassionate. </span></p><p><span>&quot;I was with the other Sages on Elucid when we got to the core and swallowed us. Then we appeared in a white vacuum with no matter around. The voices sounded like they were in my head and my material self was gone. There was nothing except for the thoughts.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The voices?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The others. They were swallowed  in the same instance.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;And then what?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I opened my eyes... and we were floating in the water around your core.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You didn&#39;t mention this part.&quot; </span></p><p><span>&quot;I didn&#39;t think its important.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Important?&quot; The cop pulled out his phone. &quot;You heard that right?&quot;</span></p><p><em><span>&quot;Yeah, the story matches exactly with the other three.&quot;</span></em></p><p><span>The cop looked back at Phaz. &quot;How do you know the others?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;From Elucid.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Tell me about Elucid. Whats it like there?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dry, deserted. Boring.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The people, where do they come from?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Earth mostly. But there is a kind born inland. Gaards.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Human?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;They look so, much taller and older. They look upon our earth as godly for the stories we tell them leave &#39;em speechless.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;How old is Elucid?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#39;t know.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The cops hesitated going on further.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Okay we had enough. Lets take him in.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The cops stood up and handcuffed Phaz, they took him to a holding cell where others arrived soon as well.</span></p><p><span>&quot;So, what did you tell them?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What I know, and I don&#39;t know much...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Did they ask you about Elucid?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yeah, you?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yeah, kalgaard?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No, they barely asked about the Gaards.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I wonder why..&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why what?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wouldnt they want to know about the locals?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I dont know.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What now?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We lost Jacob. Its just us now. We need to get back to Elucid. Something went wrong.&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;.... and why are you so sure we are not on earth right now?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Earth does not have a core like that, let alone only three cities.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yeah&quot; Phaz laughed. &quot;Birth, living and death. Its the cycle of life, and its the three cities. How cheesy the founding fathers had to be..&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Put some respect on it. Its ancient.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Who do you think this Maya woman is?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I dont know but the general said she also believes in other realms.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Afterlife?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No does it look like we were dead?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No. But..&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What? Elucid is not hell. There are infinite realms, I believe it.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But why wouldnt they just be like alternate dimension then?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Because they are apart of this universe, but on different layers of it.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Meaning?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;To bake a cake you need the ingredients and the right temperature. Something like that.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Cheese cake is pretty much just cheese.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dude...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Nah I get it. But that would just mean we move beyond the fourth dimension of time into the fifth where we can manipulate time and move beyond the present, to the future, or the past.&quot; </span></p><p><span>&quot;I dont think its like that. If our being is eternal, then time and space is merely illusion, the realm is timeless.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then how can it be timeless or space less?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If the being is split, then so is the time. If the being is split infinetely, then so is the time.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;So we are a little dot of the being, eternal being a straight line forever infinte. And the line split into countless dots?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That way we can experience the illusion of time.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Its not illusion if we are split, then time is also split so its real.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Real for us, not for the eternal being.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;So what are arguing for, the eternal being or for us?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well if we try to figure out the layers of reality, we can figure out how we get out of this layer onto ours.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But why would the eternal me allow for the tiny fraction of itself to travel upward or downward if the other fraction is already in existance in the other realm, or layer.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well what if its not. What if we were allowed to come here because in this realm we dont exist.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then its not eternal.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Right. Then I dont know.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Silence pvershadowed the dark cell room.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What if we just ask permission.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;From?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;God.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;And why would he do anything about it. If he even exists.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Mom said god is within each being. Inside.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;My mom said god shows himself through good action.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then why do most start believing in him when they are about to die but survive?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I dont know. Anyway, he&#39;s unreliable. There is a bigger chance of getting permission from the eternal self.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;And how would you even begin...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Lets find Maya first, whoever that might be.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The guards came back this time with four doctors  holding straitjackets, a garment used to restrain patients from hurting themselves. The Sages did not resist, they knew they were over their heads with the story, Phaz didn&#39;t see himself explaining this to anybody back home either without looking insane. The Sages held their arms out and to the doctors surprise the process was rather quick. Tied up with their arms imprisoned behind their backs they were led out to a van at the back of the hospital where they were taken to the W, the warden, mental institution near the cities capital square. Standing in the elevator going up to the eight floor of the hospital Lexia felt her stomach rumble.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#39;m hungry.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There will be lunch served very soon.&quot; One of the nurses answered.</span></p><p><span>The cops left them at the hospital building and Phaz thought this was the perfect opportunity to seize before anymore cops showed up. He head butted the nurses nose splashing his straightjacket with blood. He went for a forward kick knocking the second one to the ground hitting Lexia on the way. She stomped keeping him on the ground. Victoria and Pavel attacked kicking all of them to the ground. All this fighting with demons has trained them to be cold blooded assassins&#39;, Lexia thought. Surprised at what her own behavior, the elevator bell dinged, eight floor. Phaz quickly kneed the button for the door to close, when it opened there was no one in the lobby. He kneed the button again closing it pressing on the ground star. As the elevator went down they heard shouting of nurses running up to the elevator hatch on the eight floor.</span></p><p><span>&quot;They will be waiting downstairs for us.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Probably.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Lexia kicked the second floor button, the elevator went to a halt. The Sages ran out into the lobby staring at two doors on the left and right, both locked with key cards. Lexia noticed the second elevator hatch had a tiny crack in the middle of the doors. </span>
<span>&quot;Here!&quot; She ran up to it and turned around. With her hands behind her back she began pulling on the elevator door to open. Phaz caught on and he did the same to the other side. As they opened enough space between the doors Victoria stuck her boot in the middle blocking the hatch from closing. Pavel lay down on the ground and slid underneath her, then on of the doors opened on the floor and a nurse came out.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; She hesitate for a second till she realized the situation. It was to late, Lexia let go of the elevator charging the nurse with brutal leg force. The nurse ran away leaving the door behind open. The Sages got in looking at a narrow corridor with multiple doors on the left leading to offices. </span></p><p><span>&quot;Quick. Stairs!&quot; Phaz found the fire escape staricase to wich the Sages lowered themselves to the first floor. </span></p><p><span>&quot;They will be everywhere.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Basement?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</span></p><p><span>They ran skipping stairs towards the level lower into the parking lot. The augmented feeling of reality kicked in. THey still had the vests on. Fully strapped up, exit sign was mad big. they followed into sun shine. Imagine a day in LA on a hot day but new york.  </span></p><p><span>The chaos was on every block. Nothin felt out of ordinary except the feeling that someone is chasing them. Others like them rushed into the scene. Phaz saw a kid almost run over by a mustang. They split by mistake and one ran in the opposite direction. Who was first to split, they dont know,. it happened to fast. Others was the pretty augmented inflation of visual shit. Definitely off of acid drop shit, hurting the neo cortext and the hippocam0pus was hurting. They was like shit was pressure. so they switched. if the psyche is hurting the hippos like identical fractals or quantum level shit that be like attracting matter to one anether is like in formal duality. but if to much pressure htey break like atoms collpasding and shoot in opposite direction in lighting speed. On the quantum level, fuck it, that shit enough Phaz was still running when he realised he just gotta relax, and his running turned into walking. apart from the straps he still kad like white pants but the sandals from the psychiatry hospital, tragic. he sat at the nearerst park bench and just sat there in the shade. </span></p><p><span>&quot;hey wanna see a magic trick. Im david Coperfield.&quot; Phaz spazzed at a person walking bye. By the right there was already someone sitting. His tunnel vision was glue strict. He basically triked somene into untying him and he got free of the vest. the end.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>//Author opinion</span></p><p><span>I think we can all agree its just crocks. so what are we, stupid questions and crocks thats what it is. and im def humble.  what happened to us was like a horror flick  on a moon day rooftop theatre play. the name of the game is  dreams still dreams. If you ask me i steal still dreams make movies for everyday and say practice safe, if you remember then MIB will erase so dont worry about the administration. We barely lifeless. I just needed a new occupation. say less.</span></p><p><span>i was writing. took a shit. dumped it up. played the keyboard. no piano. sorry mama. never have i forever said im not lying mama. the book was just something i observed. authors op ed:</span></p><p><span>me, the coolest, augmented, plus cyborg, and artificial intelligence, influenced by internet and all its use for the mind, how to create the mind, using twelve brain rules, then perspectives of chimps touching buttons, which is closest to typing on a type writer, and emotionally scarred explosions singing damaged souls, and all in sum of me, and each other, always finding out one gotta protect the other. So why dualism. </span></p><p><span>in primordial chimp life the aggressor was a new male grown up chimp taking the life of kids of dead fathers. thats historial reality. in todays life. THe first war with the self was killing another person like me. &quot;killing a friend.&quot; The first delusional, dilemma war. The second war, &quot;beat up his mother.&quot; and there are only one known war with self. and one war known with less. the second war an extension of self is less. selfless. there is no third war in the identity search for 0ne self. It feels like this dump shit of words was because of identity crisis. I know i crashed. and i crashed for a good grave digging period. THe book was just like UZPISO. capping. still wear no cap. if its tap out its bump. dangerous. so i tap out.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Written By Emil Wolfgang Rozanowski Morris   </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>
